Luck, however, eluded them after they were given a hot chase and later apprehended close to the Takoradi Mall but one managed to escape in the process and is currently at large.
Bystanders who witnessed the incident reportedky handed the robbers severe beatings before they were handed over to the police. The victim was lucky to have had been given her valuables.

He said several reports to the police about the criminal activities of the motor riders have all not received favorable responses.
Nelson Roland, a robbery victim sharing his ordeal said a motor rider rammed into his back bumper while in traffic and when he decided to step outside the car to check the extent of damage, he returned to realize his iPhone 12 and other valuables on the front seat of his car had been stolen within a spate of two minutes.
Some market women and traders at the Koforidua Central market who were customers of defunct Fanteakwa Rural Bank have resurfaced with fresh agitations over their locked-up savings.
The agitating victims have called on President Akufo-Addo and the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin as well as the Bank of Ghana to help them retrieve their monies.
Fanteakwa Rural Bank owned by the incumbent MP for Fanteakwa North Amankwah Asiamah was established in the year 2004 but collapsed in 2012.
The Bank had its headquarters at Begoro and branches in Koforidua, Osiem, Suhum, Anyinam, and other parts of the region.
It is estimated that over 1,000 customers had their funds locked up.
The victims are mostly farmers, traders, drivers, teachers, fetish priests, small-scale miners, and small-scale enterprises.
The locked-up funds unleashed hardship on the victims some of whom died as a result while affected small scale enterprises  collapsed
Most of the customers had between five hundred Ghana cedis (GHS500.00) and twenty-seven thousand Ghana cedis (GHS27,000.00) locked up in the collapsed bank.
Many demonstrations were staged particularly before the 2016 election by the victims to exert pressure on the then Opposition lawmaker to refund their locked-up fund. Some victims received their funds but many others have still not received theirs.
Addressing the media in Koforidua, the aggrieved victims, numbering about twenty (20), chastised the lawmaker for failing to initiate plans of paying back customers.
According to them, several attempts to get their funds refunded have proven futile as they accused the MP of even failing to respond to their calls.
A 72-year old trader Elizabeth Amoah, narrating her ordeal to the media, revealed the MP promised to refund her money after the 2020 general elections but has since refused to even respond to her calls.
“I went to Begoro during the 2020 campaign season to demand my money but the MP apologized to me and promised to pay it soon after the election is over. It is sad to inform you that, the MP has not been picking my calls since after the elections, which he won,” she lamented.
She added “how can I be defrauded by an MP of my GHC12,000.000 after so many years of savings and be walking freely as a lawmaker. I am appealing to President Akufo-Addo and the Speaker to speak to Amankwah Asiamah to refund my money or we shall gather ourselves at the Jubilee House and Parliament to demand our money”.
Another victim stated “we are pleading with President Akufo Addo and the speaker, Kennedy Agyapong to intervene I am a strong NPP supporter but this MP is treating us bad. During the 2020 election I went to Begoro with my daughter to see the MP he snubbed us, I cried why should we be treated like this ”
Several other traders shared their harrowing situation including collapsed marriages as a result of hardship the locked-up funds brought upon them.
The Member of Parliament for Fanteakwa North Amankwah Asiamah who was the Chief Executive Officer of the collapsed Bank declined to comment on the latest agitations
But had earlier denied loaning deposits of the victims to sponsor Nana Akufo Addo’s campaign as alleged in 2012, hence the collapse as is peddled.
According to the MP, it is also incorrect that the bank owes over 1,000 customers explaining that his outfit managed to refund deposits of the majority of the customers.
The former Ranking Member for the Mines and Energy Committee of Parliament, Adam Mutawkilu has taunted Ghana’s Attorney General over the $170 million judgment debt case saying he would have won if the case was tried in Ghana.
According to him, the AG would have resorted to means and ways to win the case.
“We looked at it meticulously and realized that it has met all the conditions and parliament approval was condition precedent. So for me, there was no need for government to have canceled the project. No! And they know that when it goes anywhere in the world, government will lose. Then probably they thought it will be handled in Ghana. Maybe they can flex their muscles to find their way out,” the former lawmaker told Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Thursday.
The Attorney General has however blamed the erstwhile Mahama administration for the situation.
Residents in the Ajumako Ochiso Community of the Central region are excited beyond measure as a mammoth quantity of fish has appeared in their river [Ochi], which used to be just a source of drinking water for them.

This happened after Thursday dawn’s downpour. According to the residents, the mystery was a blessing from the gods.

Leaders in the community poured libations and opened up for inhabitants to apportion the bounty and take it home.

Speaking to Kasapa FM’s central regional correspondent Yaw Boagyan, Wofa Yaw Obosu who used to work at the bank of the river narrated that this has never happened since he came into the area and he also believes it’s a blessing for the community.

According to him, they will send some of the fishes to the market for sale. “Since the fishes appeared at the river bank, I have been able to employ over twenty youth to work for me to process for sale at the Mankessim, Kasoa, markets.”

“This is beyond my understanding since something of this nature has never happened in the Ajumako Ochiso Community.”

Meanwhile, some of the residents who came went the scene also appealed to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture to come and assist them in terms of providing them with tricycles to be able to transport the fishes to the market.

“We don’t have job to do in the Ajumako Ochiso Community here so this will enable us to be employed to get money to take care of our children’s education and household. We are therefore calling on authorities to come and assist us to address the challenges we are facing in the Ajumako Ochiso Community as regards employment,” a resident appealed.

The Assembly Member of the Ajumako Ochiso South Maxwell Mensah also appealed to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture and other government to assist the community members in terms of providing logistics to be able to fish for more fishes in the river for the youth to be employed.
The Executive Director for the Institute of Energy Security, Nana Amoasi VII, has taken a swipe at the Attorney General, Godfred Dame, describing him as negligent for his failure to defend Ghana on the $170 million judgment debt awarded to power company, The Ghana Power Generation Company (GCGP).

In an interview on the Morning Starr on Thursday, Nana Amoasi VII called on the Attorney General to account to Ghanaians why he failed to appeal the $170 million judgment debt in time.

“We had an opportunity to go and appeal against the decision and we chose to use Covid-19 and election as excuses. The Attorney General was negligent as well. He didn’t act well. He could have defended us better so we should look into it.”

His comments come after the Commercial Court in London rejected a late appeal from Ghana against a judgement debt award of US$170 million in favour of power contractor, The Ghana Power Generation Company (GCGP).

According to the London Court, the government of Ghana failed to apply and set aside the January 26, 2021 decision of the London-based United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Tribunal.

The court in a ruling on Wednesday, June 8, refused to grant the government of Ghana an extension to apply to set aside the award – adding that the state’s grounds for challenging it were “intrinsically weak”.

The government through its lawyer Godfred Dame had attempted to hide behind the 2020 general election and the COVID-19 pandemic as excuses for the delay, but their excuses were dismissed by the London court.

GPGC was represented before the court by Charles Kimmins QC and Mark Tushingham, where Ghana was said to have been too late to challenge the decision against it.

Ghana had used Khawar Qureshi QC of Serle Court and Volterra Fietta, having initially retained Omnia Strategy. In the arbitration, GPGC, used Three Crowns and Ghanaian firm, Kimathi & Partners, along with damages experts from FTI Consulting.

Ghana also had representation from the attorney general’s office and Amofa & Partners in Accra.

The three-member arbitration tribunal chaired by John Beechey, a former President of the International Criminal Court’s Court of Arbitration, and co-chaired by Prof Albert Fiadjoe, a Ghanaian academic, sided with the power producer and awarded almost US$170 million, including interest.

Out of the total, U$134.35 million represents the early termination payment claim, which itself is made up of US $69.36 million as an early termination fee, US$58.49 million for mobilisation costs, US$6.46 million as demobilisation cost and US$32,448 as preservation and maintenance cost.

The tribunal also awarded US$614,353.86 against the country as the cost of the tribunal, and costs of US$3 million against Ghana, being the legal fees expended by the GPGC during the arbitration.

Major highlights of the tribunal’s decision included the fact that the Ahenkora Committee which recommended the termination of the contract did not have sufficient ground in coming to the conclusion that the GPGC was entitled to only $US18 million in early termination fees.

The tribunal, in dismissing Ghana’s case, delved into the basis for terminating the contract, stating that the evidence before it indicated that “GPGC did have a building permit for the Blue Ocean Site issued by the Kpone-Katamanso District Assembly on  August 15, 2017.”

“GoG [The government] has not been able to adduce any statute or regulation, including the Energy Commission Act, which addresses the requirement for any such additional construction permit,” the Tribunal ruled.

“On the basis of the record as it now stands, it is apparent that even as Dr. Ahenkorah [Energy Commission Executive Secretary at the time]  was putting up further hurdles over which he required GPGC to jump in pursuit of its provisional generation license in November 2017, the Minister of Energy was about to seek the approval of the Ghanaian Parliament of a decision to terminate the EPA along with a number of other PPAs, based upon the Report of the PPA Committee chaired by Dr. Ahenkorah,” it said.

Under British law, the government had 28 days to challenge the tribunal’s decision. However, it went to sleep only to appear in court three days to the expiry of the deadline to ask for an extension.

Omnia Strategy, a British law firm, made the case for extension and asked for 56 days—twice the allowed grace period.

However, the court set March 8, 2021, for the Government to file the processes to challenge the Tribunal’s decision in January. But again, the government took a long nap until April 1, 2021, before filing. This time, another British law firm, Volterra Fietta, had instructions from the government to begin the process.

The law firm, which tagged itself as the only dedicated public international law firm in the world, explained that the new Attorney General, Godfred Yeboah Dame, had only been sworn in on March 5, and the firm received the directive to represent Ghana 10 days later.

But ruling on the matter on June 8, 2021, the court had no sympathies. It said the excuses were unreasonable and “intrinsically weak.”

The presiding judge, Justice Butcher did not hold back.

The judge said the government’s delay was “significant and substantial” as its request for a second extension had come 38 days after the statutory deadline and 27 days after the first extension expired, the Global Arbitration Review (GAR) reported.

He noted that the large sum of money involved in the arbitration was not enough grounds for the appeal to take as long as it did.

“The fact that the Attorney General had not been sworn until March 5 did not mean the government was unable to act in the meantime, the judge said.

Background to the arbitration 

The International Court of Arbitration in January 2021 awarded a cost of $134 million and an interest of $30 million against the Government of Ghana over the cancellation of an Emergency Power Agreement with GCGP limited.

The Contract was cancelled under the former Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko as part of several other energy contracts cancelled by the NPP on the basis that the country did not need those power agreements.

The ruling by the International Court of Arbitration ordered the government to Ghana to pay to “GPGC the full value of the Early Termination Payment, together with Mobilization, Demobilization and preservation and maintenance costs in the amount of US$ 134,348,661, together also with interest thereon from 12 November 2018 until the date of payment, accruing daily and compounded monthly, at the rate of LIBOR for six-month US dollar deposits plus six per cent(6%).”

The Government of Ghana was also to pay GPGC an amount of “US$ 309,877.74 in respect of the Costs of the Arbitration, together with US$ 3,000,000 in respect of GPGC’s legal representation and the fees and expenses of its expert witness, together with interest on the aggregate amount of US$ 3,309,877.74 at the rate of LIBOR for three-month US dollar deposits, compounded quarterly.”
A baby has been reportedly washed away in Sawaba in Kumasi following the Wednesday evening rains in the Ashanti regional capital.

The baby was traveling with his parents in a tricycle when they got stuck in a flood causing the tricycle to tip over.

Residents in the community, according to reports, moved in to save the parents but could not find the baby as he was washed away by the flood.

“The body of the baby who was washed away hasn’t been found. The parents are not taking it easy at all. When it rains, it’s difficult to use the Sawaba road. The gutters become flooded so we don’t know why the tricycle rider tried using the road that led to the death of the 1-yr-old baby,” a resident told Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Thursday.

Other reports also say the convoy of President Akufo-Addo which was returning from the Upper East region got stuck in the flood.
A suspected notorious armed robber, Iddrisu Adams alias Koomi, who was arrested by the Ashanti Regional Police Command in connection with a series of robberies has been shot by Police in a bid to stop him from escaping lawful custody.
The suspect was on the wanted list of the command and was arrested on 22nd June 2021 through a special police operation.
On 23rd June 2021, he was being escorted to places named by him as hide-outs of his accomplices when he attempted to escape. The police responded swiftly by shooting him.
The suspect was taken to the St. Martins Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
A release by the police stated that they are on the lookout for his accomplices who are advised to surrender by reporting to the nearest Police Station.
The Police also assured the public of their commitment to prevent and fight crime and called on the public for cooperation.
The Minister for National Security Albert Kan Dapaah has revealed details surrounding the forceful eviction of former Ashanti Regional Security Coordinator DCOP Opare-Addo (rtd) from office by some National Security operatives.

According to Kan Dapaah, the move became necessary after several attempts to get the security Coordinator to vacate post after the termination of his appointment proved futile.

The ejected coordinator told Starr News he was evicted by members of NPP affiliated vigilante group, Delta Force, who assaulted him in the process for failing to do their bidding in the region.

But answering questions from South Dayi MP Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpo, the national security minister explained the men dispatched were national security operatives.

He, however, refused to disclose reasons for the termination of the appointment of Mr. Opare-Addo insisting the use of force was necessary under the circumstances.

“He [Opare-Addo] was on a three-year contract to serve as the Ashanti regional security liaison officer after the expiration of an initial two-year contract which began on January 5th, 2018. His new appointment took effect from January 1, 2020, and was to expire on December 31, 2022.”

“However, his appointment was terminated on February 19, 2021, by the national security coordinator. Upon the termination of his contract, DCOP Opare-Addo was paid his entitlements as per his appointment letter. Subsequent to the termination of the appointment, the ministry appointed Col Francis Arthur (rtd) as the new Ashanti regional security liaison officer. The colonel’s appointment took effect from 1st May 2021. But he [Opare-Addo] refused to hand over to Colonel Francis Arthur. He then declined numerous invitations from the national security coordinator to explain his refusal to vacate the office.”

Mr Dapaah further explained “Meanwhile, his continuous stay in office obstructed the work of the new regional security liaison officer. Against this backdrop, personnel from the ministry of national security were on 11th May 2021 dispatched to the Ashanti region to ascertain the reason for DCOP Opare Addo’s refusal to vacate his office. And if it became necessary to change the locks of the door to his office. On arrival, the personnel duly introduced themselves but were met with acts of hostility from DCOP Opare-Addo, including drawing his sidearm. The personnel managed to persuade him and retrieved the sidearm.”

He added “till date, no official complaint has been made by DCOP Opare-Addo either to his immediate boss the national security coordinator or to me as the sector minister regarding the alleged assault on him. Neither has the minister of national security received any correspondence from the police in relation to the allegations.”

“I will want to assure the house of our willingness to investigate the incident should any official complaint be made by DCOP Opare-Addo.”

The Government has moved to avert attacks from Burkinabe bandits in Ghana as it announces the construction of permanent barracks in Bawku to enhance security in that part of the country

The announcement made by President Akufo-Addo comes just a week after security agencies were put on high alert to fore-planned attacks by bandits from Burkina Faso.

He was speaking at a meeting with the Bawku Naba to end his tour of the Upper-East region.

“The proximity of your region to Burkina Faso makes it an obvious potential target for these murderers and criminals who want to destabilize and terrorize our lives in Ghana.”

He went on”Bawku Naba, you are aware of the measures that the government is taking to strengthen the security agencies here and protect us from terrorist attacks emanating from Burkina Faso.

“And I’m happy to inform you that a permanent baracks is going to be established here in this area to be able to address the issue of terrorism.”

Meanwhile, the Bawku Naba, who is also President of the Kusaug Traditional Council, Asigiri Abugrago Azoka II, said the Chiefs and People of the Kusaug Traditional Area, and, indeed, all Ghanaians appreciate the policies of the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

I wish you God’s continued blessing in wisdom as well as good health to execute your policies.”

More than two in ten (22%) see the country’s future as bleak”.On Education and opportunities, the survey said: “Over half of the children (53%) say they are optimistic. 47% of the respondents paint a bleak picture as to how the country’s current educational system would help them find jobs in the next 20 years”.
Some youth groups in the Ashanti region have threatened to shut down branches of the  Lighthouse Chapel International in the region over a critical sermon delivered by the leader of the church Bishop Dag Heward-Mills which appeared to attack the Ashanti Monarch Otumfuo Osei Tutu.

The said sermon, which has found its way onto social media, is said to be questioning the impact of the influential king on his subjects and community.

According to the group, the popular televangelist has slighted the revered traditional leader and must go beyond an apology to atone for his sins.

“We are calling on Bishop Dag to seek wise counsel within 48 hours. Otherwise, none of his churches in the Asanteman enclave will be allowed to operate. Also, we are warning all and sundry who hide behind religion and politics to push this evil agenda against Asanteman and his royal majesty Otumfuo Osei Tutu. We will let them know that we will meet them up with brute force” the General Secretary of one of the groups Kwabena Frimpong said.

Bishop Dag Heward-Mills has however apologised over the sermon.

In an apology, the Preacher said: “I am deeply saddened that a message I shared at a conference, nearly 20 years ago, has been taken out of its context and circulated by persons who have previously declared that they will maliciously cause our churches in Kumasi to be closed down.

“I wish to apologize to His Majesty Otumfuo Nana Osei Tutu II for any disrespect, insult or harm caused him or his royal court. Please accept my profound apologies for the statements I made”.

The National Democratic Congress has slammed Chief Justice Kwasi Anin-Yeboah, describing his petition to the General Legal Council against lawmaker, Dominic Ayine, as an attempt to suppress free speech.

Dr Ayine is reported to have said the Supreme Court failed to apply the rules of procedure during the trial. He is also believed to have raised concerns over the regular dismissal of the petitioners’ applications during the case.

He made the comments at an event organised by the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD) and the KNUST.

The petition by the Chief Justice urged the GLC to probe the lawmaker over the comments and apply the necessary sanctions.

Addressing a Press Conference on Monday, the General Secretary of the NDC, Johnson Asiedu Nketia called on the Chief Justice to immediately the petition against the MP for Bolgatanga East.

“Public confidence in the judiciary must be earned and not forced on us. How many times have you heard any court telling anybody that I’m going to give a judgment but I’m warning you not to talk about it?” Mr Asiedu Nketia popularly known as General Mosquito said.

He added that “The judiciary, like parliament or executive, is not above criticism…Our laws and constitution protect the integrity and independence of the judiciary and not the sensibility of a judge. The notion that the judicial arm of gov’t is beyond reproach is a fantasy that can’t be sustained.”

Mr Asiedu Nketia also accused the Chief Justice of targeting NDC affiliated lawyers and called on him to stop the witch-hunt.

“It’s no coincidence that virtually all the lawyers who have been reported to the disciplinary committee of the General Legal council by the Chief Justice, Justice Kwasi Anin Yeboah in recent times are aligned to the NDC. What is the Chief Justice’s personal interest in the punishment of NDC affiliated lawyers that his he’s so keen to initiate unwarranted actions against them”
Ghana has been ranked the second most peaceful country in Africa behind Mauritius in the 2021 Global Peace Index report by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP).

The Global Peace Index is the world’s leading measure of global peacefulness. The index ranks 163 independent states and territories according to their level of peacefulness. This report presents the most comprehensive data-driven analysis to date on trends in peace, its economic value, and how to develop peaceful societies.

In the latest rankings, Ghana ranked 38th in the world out of a total of 163 countries reviewed. Ghana scored 1.715 which represents a two-point move upwards from the country’s previous position.

Mauritius, the most peaceful country in Africa ranked 28th globally, while Botswana ranked third place in Africa and 41st in the world. Nigeria ranked 146 globally behind Togo, Uganda, Kenya, The Republic of Congo and Cameroon.

Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Denmark, Portugal, and Slovenia.

Afghanistan is the least peaceful country in the world for the fourth consecutive year, followed by Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, and Iraq. Burkina Faso recorded the largest deterioration in the Global Peace Index 2021.

According to the report, half of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had a recent experience of violence. Those living in Namibia had the highest experience of violence in the world at 6 per cent.

South Sudan remains the least peaceful country in the region and one of the least peaceful countries in the world, despite an improvement in peacefulness in the 2021 index.

The largest deterioration in peacefulness in the region occurred in Burkina Faso. This was also the single largest deterioration of any country. The government’s decision to fund and arm civilian auxiliary groups in its fight against insurgents drove the plunge.

The report highlighted that civil unrest rose 10 per cent globally, driven by the coronavirus pandemic. There were 14,871 violent demonstrations, protests and riots recorded globally in 2020.

The report said Covid was a “multiplying force” in future political instability and civil unrest. It added the level of this unrest going forward is likely to hinge on the speed and effectiveness of economic recovery. Countries with less debt and higher levels of positive peace were more likely to recover faster.

Despite this, overall three-quarters of people globally feel as safe or safer today than they did five years ago. Some indicators of violence have recorded significant improvements since the start of the index, and 123 countries have seen murder rates fall since 2008.

The Index also revealed that “the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.07 per cent in the 2021 Global Peace Index. Although a relatively small deterioration, this is the ninth time in the last 13 years that global peacefulness has deteriorated”.

The report added that “in the past year, 87 countries recorded an improvement in peacefulness, while 73 countries recorded a deterioration. Three countries recorded no change in their overall score. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world’s least peaceful region. It is home to three of the five least peaceful countries in the world. However, it recorded the largest regional improvement over the past year”.

“Europe…remains the most peaceful region in the world. The region is home to eight of the ten most peaceful countries, and no country in Europe is ranked outside the top half of the index”.
President-elect Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has assured Ghanaians that they will see an improvement in the standard of living under his presidency.

According to him, the next four years must have a positive impact on the life of the ordinary Ghanaian.

“I am extremely concerned, that the next four years will see a marked improvement in the living standards of the people of Ghana,” the president-elect made the comments during his official tour to Nigeria after he won the presidential elections.

Mr. Akufo-Addo addressing the Governor of the Imo State in Nigeria Owelle Rochas Anayo Okorocha, Monday added: “the Ghanaian economy has taken a hit in these last three or four years but we believe with discipline, with hard work and correct set of policies we should be able to bring the country back to prosperity.”

The president-elect who beat Incumbent President, John Dramani Mahama in the just ended presidential election is on a three-day visit to Nigeria where he will have discussions with the oil producing country’s leader, Muhammudu Buhari.

Mr. Akufo-Addo also assured the Imo State governor that relationship between the two West African countries will be strengthened under his presidency.

“We value the historic relationship between the two countries. It is important that such links are established between our people and our leaders. They give confidence to our populations that we are working to try and resolve their problems and help them progress with their lives…the stronger the relationship between the two countries is, the better it is for the West Africa Region and the continent large,” he added.
President John Dramani Mahama has confirmed Joseph Whittal as the new Commissioner for the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ).

Mr. Whittal was sworn-in at a short ceremony at the Flagstaff House Tuesday afternoon.

Mr. Whittal has been acting as the head for CHRAJ since the former commissioner, Lauretta Vivian Lamptey was removed by the President after causing financial loss to the state.

The President has appointed Ms. Josephine Nkrumah as the substantive head of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE).

Ms. Nkrumah who was a deputy chairman for the commission replaces Mrs. Charlotte Osei, wdho was as the head of the country’s Electoral Commission by the President in July last year.

The appointments come few weeks after the President lost the presidential election to opposition NPP leader Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.

The president-elect will be sworn-in on January 7, 2017.
GN Health Insurance Company Ltd, one of the 75 companies of Groupe Nduom has begun operating Ambulance Services in Ghana.

It is expected to among other tasks offer emergency medical service and administer emergency care to those with acute medical problems.

The GN Health Ambulance Service shall also provide a 24-hour response to medical and trauma related emergencies and interventions.

The chairman of GN Health Issah Adam noted “once again the President and CEO of Groupe Nduom, Dr Papa Kwesi Nduom, as well as the Senior Vice President, Mrs Yvonne Nduom and all the Directors are once more setting the pace in terms of providing improved welfare services to employees of the Group”.

He told the gathering of health professionals “this marks yet another milestone in the annals of Groupe Nduom. In addition to providing free medical services, they are adding this Ambulance Service to complete the bouquet of Medical Services for the benefit of employees of the group in Greater Accra and Central Regions”.

Over 60% of deaths in Ghana, according to available statistics, are as a result of unavailable ambulance service to transport women in labour and accident victims to the appropriate medical facility. Experts believe the conditions leading to deaths can be addressed by appropriate and timely emergency care like what GN Health Ambulance Service seeks to achieve.

“GN Health will make sure that we have well trained EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians) and Ambulance Drivers who are well trained and know exactly what to do in emergency situations.

“The Ford 350 ambulances, are well equipped with modern equipment and consumables needed for emergency situations and pre-hospital care to patients. Please take note that these are not just ambulances to provide transport services that cannot provide proper pre-hospital care,” he added.

The Ambulances have a more robust set of equipment for pre-hospital care. They are equipped with tools necessary for multiple types of emergencies, from respiratory assistance machines and defibrillators to items as simple as bandages and disinfectant solution.
Government has promised to absorb the costs of treatment for injured victims of Thursday’s gas explosion at La.

Six people have been confirmed dead in the gas explosion that occurred near the Trade Fair Centre in Accra while over 20 people have sustained various degrees of injuries.

The Health Minister Alex Segbefia visiting victims at the La General, Police and 37 Military hospitals where some of the victims were receiving treatment, commended medical officers for their professionalism in caring for the victims.

“The president has indicated clearly that all the costs of the burn victims from this incident will be covered by the state, so we’ve made it clear to the management and the Brigadier General-in-charge, the commandant, that they should quickly put together all the logistics and costs of caring for these patients.

“As you know with burn victims, there is the need to constantly wash, constantly change dressing, and put them on antibiotics and very strong pain killers, so there is for each patient a cost. You have to bring in extra staff to actually deal with it and this has been done in a very military-type fashion in this hospital,” he stated.

Meanwhile, President John Dramani Mahama has called on Ghanaians to pray for victims of Thursday’s gas explosion.

In a Facebook post Friday, the outgoing president took to his Facebook wall to console the victims.

“My condolences to families of the victims of yesterday’s gas explosion; let’s continue to pray for the injured.”
A gas station near the Ghana International Trade Fair Centre in Accra has exploded with five people burnt to death.
The fire, according to an eyewitness also affected parts of the national exhibition and trade centre.
According to Veronica Koomson, an ambulance and fire tenders at the scene managed to fight the intense blaze which has sent people running helter-skelter.
“The fire is blazing and we are doing everything possible to quench it. The Armed Forces fire fighters are here too and doing everything possible to ensure this fire is actually extinguished,” the spokesperson of the Ghana National Fire Service (GNFS) Prince Billy-Anaglatey told Starr News’ Kemini Amanor on Thursday.
Koomson said another gas station which is situated near the burning one is likely to go up in flames if the fire fighters do not put up measures to salvage the situation.
However, Billy-Anaglatey said he cannot confirm any casualty, adding “our concern now is to confine the fire” so it does not catch up with the other.”
The cause of the explosion is not known. There is total blackout at the area as electricity cables also caught fire in the melee.
One person has died in a ghastly accident which occurred last night at Ekumfi Akoti in the Ekumfi district of the Central region.
The deceased, a Nigerian, lost his life when the truck he was driving veered off the road and caught fire.
The truck which was loaded with Cola was on its way to Nigeria from Mankessim.
According to eyewitnesses, the vehicle veered into a nearby bush when the deceased lost control.
However,  bystanders managed to save two other passengers who were in the vehicle before it caught fire, and burnt  the driver to death on the spot.  
The two are currently receiving treatment at the Cape Coast regional hospital.
Officers of the Ghana Fire Service later arrived at the scene to control the inferno.
The accident brings to two, the number of terrible accidents that have occurred in the area over the last two weeks.
A fortnight  ago, 15 people died on the same stretch of road in a crash between a Yutong bus and a Sprinter.
Some chiefs in the Ga traditional area have given the Gbese mantse, Nii Ayibonte, a seven-day ultimatum to relinquish his throne.
The Chiefs are angry with the Gbese Chief over claims he made prior to the 2016 general elections.
Nii Ayibonte promised to abdicate his throne if president John Mahama loses the presidential election.
Nii Ayibonte told his subjects before the election that he had no doubt Mahama would win the election based on the numerous infrastructural projects.
But luck eluded the former Chairman of Accra Hearts of Oak after he gambled with his seat.
Nii Ayibonte has not whispered a word about what he intends to do after the massive victory of Nana Akufo-Addo.
The Ga Chiefs who are demanding he abdicates his throne have also pricked old wounds. They are also challenging his eligibility as the Gbese chief.
Two women were killed and more than 12 others injured, after a car lost control on the abandoned Daboya- Busunu road in the Northern region and rammed into a gutter Tuesday evening, police have confirmed.
The car, a mini van had 14 passengers who were being transported to Daboya from Sawla to attend an Islamic wedding ceremony.
The West Gonja district police commander ASP Seidu Wemeh said the car with registration number AS 2304-15 upon reaching a community near Daboya suddenly veered off the road and summer saulted into a gutter killing the two instantly .
The deceased were female adults between the ages of 42- 45 respectively.
It is still undetermined what caused the crash but according to ASP Seidu, police will technically investigate the mental state of the driver and whether alcohol was involved.
He added most of the injured were transported to the regional hospital in Tamale with only one being treated at Damongo.
Accident on the Daboya-Busunu road are uncommon despite its bad nature.
Community members have denied the report saying this is the first time in the year an accident is recorded on the neglected road. 
They say most accidents go unreported.
The Minister of Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh, has said the Government is working towards boosting Ghana's industrialisation with clean and reliable energy systems, such as nuclear and renewables.
He said there was a growing consensus that nuclear energy had an important role in decarbonising electricity generation for accelerated industrial development.
“While renewable energy sources are expected to continue to grow significantly, nuclear power, an important part of today’s clear energy, is also the largest source of lower-carbon electricity generation in advanced economies, providing approximately 40 percent of all low carbon generations,” he said.
He referred to an International Energy Agency report on clean energy system asserting that without nuclear investment, achieving a sustainable energy system would be much harder with implications to emissions, cost and energy security.
Dr Opoku Prempeh stated this, in a speech read on his behalf, at a Stakeholders Forum on Ghana’s Nuclear Power Programme in Accra.
Under the theme: “Nuclear Energy Innovations: The Future Technologies for Clean Energy and how to drive deep decarbonisation of Ghana’s power sector", the forum was organised by the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), in collaboration with Nuclear Power Ghana (NPG).
Dr Opoku Prempeh noted that turning to clean energy systems for electricity generation would also decarbonise other areas, such as transportation, and other environmental pollution activities.
"Within Ghana’s power generation side, issues on consistent demand growth, high tariff for industries, affordability, reliability, and resilience criteria have brought to the fore the issue of an alternative base-load power," he stated.
Considering the facts available on the country's energy needs, capacity, cost and other related issues, nuclear energy, he said, could provide that alternative clean base-load power.
“A new nuclear power station does not only generate reliable low carbon electricity but also provides wider social-economic benefits both during its development, construction and the subsequent 60 years that the plant would be in operation.”
He recalled that in 2007, former President John Agyekum Kufuor set up a committee, chaired by Professor Daniel Adzei-Bekoe, to explore the possibility of Ghana using nuclear energy as an alternative based-load source of power.
This was around the time that Ghana was faced with supply power challenges.
To sustain the natural progression of the country’s technological energy advancement, he noted, subsequent governments had supported this effort to improve the country’s energy security to provide leadership and resources to facilitate the nuclear power programme.
This has given birth to the NPG to become the owner/operator of Ghana’s first nuclear power plant.
He said the NPG Board, under the chairmanship of Mr Fred Oware, was focused on providing relevant resources to build a strong safety culture and resilience management systems that adhered to standards in the planning and development of nuclear infrastructure and related activities across the country.
In addition to electricity generation, nuclear energy, the Minister said, could provide solutions to an even wider range of applications - those innovative nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors would complement existing large reactors to enable deep decarbonization as part of the clean energy transition.
"Nuclear technologies are equally improving people’s lives in many other ways and are supporting sustainable developments," he said.
"Medical, industry and agriculture applications of nuclear technology are in use all over the world, including Ghana.
The affixing of tax stamps on alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages has grown exponentially since its introduction about four years ago.
From an initial 28.5 million tax stams affixed in 2018, the number increased to 38.5 million the following year and 70.2 million in 2020, with managers of the project projecting to affix some 90 million stamps in 2021.
The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) said it was also engaging the Food and Beverages Association of Ghana (FABAG) and local manufacturers to pay for the affixing of the stamps on their beverage products at the stamping facilities.
The Ghanaian printing company, Buck Press, and its partner, DelaRue, a British security printing company, are responsible for printing the tax stamps on behalf of the GRA, while Streamline Resources, which is located at the Tema Port, assists companies without the technical capacity to fix the stamps on individual products.
The Project Manager of Excise Tax Stamp at the GRA, Mr Kwabena Apau Awuah Anto, who disclosed this, said the move would reduce the incidence of product fraud and piracy, where importers and manufacturers applied for the stamps for specific products but affixed them on pirated products that had no approval and safety certification from the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA).
Speaking during a tour of the tax stamp facilities at the Tema Port by a team from the Graphic Communications Group Limited (GCGL) last Thursday, Mr Anto noted that the Commissioner General of the GRA had already granted authorisation to some 34 large importers and manufacturers, including Guinness Ghana Limited and the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, to undertake the affixing of the stamps at their factories at their own cost.
The GGCL team, which was led by the Managing Director, Mr Ato Afful, included the Editor of the Daily Graphic, Mr Kobby Asmah; the Director, Marketing, Mr Franklin Sowa, and the Editor of The Mirror, Ms Doreen Hammond.
The team was in Tema to have firsthand appreciation of progress of the excise tax stamp policy and also explore collaboration with the GRA on how to further advance the initiative.
Mr Anto said the excise stamp policy would reduce product fraud and ensure that only wholesome products were allowed into the market space to ensure public health and safety..
Similarly, he said, the policy would ensure revenue assurance and further level the playing field for importers and manufacturers to compete fairly on the market through the payment of appropriate taxes.
Mr Anto said: “What we do here at the Tema facilities and 13 other stations across the country where we have affixing facilities is at no cost to importers.”
Operating the facilities, he said, came with headline costs such as the procurement of the stamps, utility, labour, operational cost and materials such as shrink wraps
He indicated that when the project took off in 2018, the government decided to give a six-month window to supply the stamps for free, but that had continued till date, hence the Commissioner General's directive for the stakeholders to be engaged and sensitised to the need for them to pay.
The engagements, Mr Anto said, would determine whether the GRA would charge the full cost or there would be cost sharing between it and the stakeholders.
“In countries such as Kenya, importers pay for the stamps or they get the products stamped at the point of export. 
Ghana's policy on the tax stamp policy places the responsibility on the affected excise product on the importer or the manufacturer. 
In many countries where similar policies are implemented, manufacturers have affixing facilities at their production units,” Mr Anto said.
On the recent challenges that saw delays and congestion at the facility, which led to an outcry among importers, Mr Anto explained that the Tema facilities were not meant for large volume importers but for people who only imported occasionally.
However, he said, large volume importers, in their attempt to avoid associated costs that came with the affixing, often sent their products to the facilities for stamping, a situation which resulted in congestion and delays.
Similarly, challenges with the stamps after a change in the service provider also resulted in some delays, he noted.
However, engineers worked on the machines to be able to pick the new stamps.
In his remarks, Mr Asmah called on the GRA to intensify education on policies that were periodically introduced into the trade space.
Tax education, he said, was important, since it would ensure compliance at all levels and also ensure that people did not short-change the system.
He commended officials of the GRA and the service provider, Streamline Resources, for taking steps to address the challenges.
The GCGL, he said, would collaborate with the GRA to scale up its sensitisation efforts, having had an insight into the operations of the excise tax stamp policy.
“I believe this is the right time for the GCGL and the GRA to deepen collaboration for the purpose of public sensitisation, so that we can get a buy-in from the public,” Mr Asmah said.
he Institute of Energy Security (IES) has said prices of fuel will appreciate marginally at the pumps. A statement issued by IES indicated that the price of fuel on the local market increased within the window under review.
Within the first pricing window of June 2021, majority of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) increased their prices of petroleum products by 3% at the pump. Based on this increase, the current national average price of fuel per litre at the pump is pegged at GHS5.97 for both gasoline and gasoil.   
For this pricing window, Zen Petroleum, Benab Oil, Cash Oil, Goodness Oil, Top Oil and Frimps Oil sold the least-priced fuel on the local market, according to IES’ market scan.
For the window under assessment, international benchmark Brent crude price averaged $73.98 per barrel, representing a 4.05% increase from the previous window's average price of $71.10 per barrel.
This window’s increase in price has been largely in response to the rise in COVID-19 cases propelled by the Delta variant in parts of Europe and amid warnings of a dense outbreak in the United States. 
For the first time in two years, the price of Brent reached the $75-mark at the end of the pricing window. The global crude demand is rebounding as the summer driving season begins and economies reopen from restrictions in mobility.
This is particularly the case, as road and airline travel continue to increase.
The increase in Brent crude prices has also been attributed to the tightening of the physical crude supply in parts of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as a result of the dynamics in spread between the regional benchmarks within the period.
The July 1st OPEC+ meeting to decide on the production policy for August is also expected to offset the markets, as we go into the month of July.
Gasoline and gasoil prices, as monitored on Standard and Poor’s global Platts platform, show that the prices of international commodities gasoline (petrol) and gasoil (diesel) experienced marginal differences within the period.
Gasoline saw an increase in price by 3.47% to close the window at $694.78 per metric tonne from an earlier $671.45 per metric tonne in the previous window.
Gasoil price also increased by 3.53% to close trading at $597.30 per metric tonne from the earlier window's price of $576.89 per metric tonne. 
Data collated by IES’ Economic Desk from the Foreign Exchange (Forex) market shows the cedi maintained its stability, still trading at GH¢5.77 to the US dollar.
South Africa has been added to Nigeria’s ‘red list’ of countries for arriving passengers. Nigeria took the decision because of the covid19 Delta variant in South Africa.
Travelers who visited South Africa in the past 14 days are now banned from entering Nigeria. 
Nigerian passport holders and residents coming from South Africa have to undergo a seven-day quarantine.
Brazil and Turkey are also on the list.
The killing of Kaaka Mohammed is unfortunate and regrettable. 
My condolence to the family and may his soul Rest In Peace. 
But quickly, some have started pointing accusing fingers at the current regime with others expressing the hope that this shouldn’t be state-sponsored. 
This is also not too good, as it would not allow proper investigations to be undertaken. 
Looking at the official government responses to the “Fix The Country”, agitation, I doubt whether this killing may be sanctioned by the state, even though I am also very much aware that, in our kind of nauseating politics, everything may be possible, including turning a man into a woman and vice versa. 
Government met the agitators to try and calm them down. 
Later, the agitations compelled, at least, two pressers to explain what government is doing to fix the country.
But of course, there are the hawks within the regime, who demonstrated intolerance by calling the bluff of the agitators and asking them to first fix themselves. 
Then, we have our Police Service, that typically tried to frustrate the intentions of the agitators to demonstrate, using very nonsensical explanations of Covid as basis, when they could not prevent or disperse the mammoth crowd at Sir John’s funeral. 
These things make any attempt to link the state to abuses, including murder of an agitator, easy and plausible, even though skepticisms can be entertained because of the absence of watertight evidence.
We must also know, and not be oblivious of the fact that sometimes, our nasty and very dirty politics may push individuals outside government, to carry out such abuses, just for the purposes of deepening agitations and making governments unpopular. 
Again, there is no evidence to support this, in the case of Kaaka’s death. 
But as we analyze the situation, through the lenses of fairness and objectivity, we must do so broadly, to cover all probabilities.
For the ignorant and unprofessional soldiers who went to kill two more human beings, I won’t blame them too much. 
We must blame their mode of recruitment and training. 
Regimes would continue to suffer even more monumental embarrassments from unprofessional security forces, so long as recruitments into these agencies are politicized and based not on meritocracy was part of the 2000 Mobrowa Struggle and I played an active role, sometimes as the “Divine Drummer” for our group. 
We saw the professional manner with which the police and the soldiers handled us even when they had to physically stop us for being unruly. 
Who squats to shoot when demonstrations are on going? 
What was he aiming at? Human being or “beela”? 
Is that how to shoot to disperse? 
How was this soldier recruited? 
Who hired him? Who trained him? 
He is indeed a square peg in a round hole, wearing a military camouflage attire. 
Elsewhere, I am touting our democratic credentials to some scholars and African leaders. 
But behind the scenes, they are pointing these abuses to contradict my claims about Ghana’s drive towards democratic maturity. 
The point is, the kind of unbridled hawkish-intolerance exhibited by some elements within regimes and the childish manner with which our security agencies act in dealing with demonstrators, constitute a severe blot on the maturation of our democratization process. 
Are Ghanaian demonstrators immune to tear-gas? 
How about the hot water canons and rubber billets? 
Government may want to fire some security heads to send a certain signal that would compel and elicit highly professional conduct of our security agencies when it comes to crowd management and dealing with demonstrators. Government may also want to send top security brass to school again for them to be socialized in the dogmas of the kind of relational competence they need, to talk agitators out of demonstration, if need be, rather than the very cheap and democratically infantile way of quickly running to court, to seek injunction. 
This only annoys and presents a needless potential recipe for revolt.  
The President may have to personally intervene to give the needed assurances, bring peace and finality to this impasse. 
The security agencies have lost credibility in the sight of the agitators and demonstrators. 
The near-docility of our Peace Council has also created a certain legitimacy deficit that may make the Council ineffective in intervening. Given these challenges, the President’s personal intervention may be helpful and this must be done in a timeous manner.
19-year-old Thomas Amoani, a graduate of the Adeiso Presbyterian Senior High School who was offered a full scholarship by the Ghana Scholarships Secretariat has expressed his appreciation to the government of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo.
Thomas Amoani, who had eight A‘s in last year’s West Africa Secondary School Certificate Examination was immediately offered a scholarship to study at the prestigious Brunel University in London after a directive to the Registrar of the Secretariat, Mr Kingsley Agyemang.
The 19-year-old boy, from Asuaba, near Adeiso and from a very poor background, will be studying Economics and Business Finance for his bachelor’s degree.
The story of the former student of the Adeiso SHS made headlines after he was interviewed by a news portal. Sharing his story, Thomas Amoani recounted how he used to trek for about 12 kilometres to school.
This caught the attention of His Excellency President Akufo-Addo who immediately asked that he be offered a full scholarship.
During a short media engagement held for him prior to his departure at the Scholarship Secretariat, the Registrar said the honour done Thomas by the President will go a long way to motivate others to also strive hard academically irrespective of their background.
“I foresee a lot of Thomases coming up and I can assure them that the Scholarships Secretariat will be there to offer them the needed support. Thomas’ story should be a motivation to others like him. And I must commend President Akufo-Addo for his swift intervention,” Mr. Agyemang said.
Arriving at the university campus, Thomas Amoani, who could not hide his joy says he is ready to raise the flag of Ghana high and will not let the country down.
“I never imagined I will be given such an opportunity by Mr. President through the hardworking Registrar. I am very grateful for the confidence reposed in me. I will not fail my country Ghana,” he said.
Brunel University London is a public research university located in the Uxbridge area of London, England. Founded in 1966 and named after the Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it is ranked as the 93rd best university worldwide in the field of engineering and technology, 32nd among European institutions and 11th among British institutions according to THES world rankings.
There is no problem with the Chief Justice, Justice Kwasi Anin Yeboah filing a disciplinary complaint against legal practitioner and Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga East, Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine at the General Legal Council (GLC).
According to private legal practitioner and former Member of Parliament for Zebilla, Mr John Ndebugre, the arguments being made by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and other people against the complaint are issues, which should be dealt with when Dr Ayine appears before the Disciplinary Committee of the General Legal Council (GLC).
"I think he [Chief Justice] was the proper person to initiate a complaint because the statement that Dr Ayine made which resulted in this complaint was that, in summary, his confidence in the independence of the judiciary has been shaken somehow by the manner in which the presidential election petition was handled or determined."
The Chief Justice has reported lawyer Dr Dominic Akuritinga Ayine to the Disciplinary Committee of the GLC for statements he allegedly made during a panel discussion on Presidential Election Petitions and their impact on Africa's Democracy.
Dr. Ayine has been accused of questioning the independence of the Judiciary due to the manner the Supreme Court adjudicated the 2020 presidential election petition.
The petition says Dr. Ayine’s basis for his assertion during the discussion is the Supreme Court's failure to apply the rules of procedure as well as the consistent and continuous dismissal of the petitioner's applications or reliefs.
“These comments are made against the backdrop of the Supreme Court discharging Dr. Ayine on a charge of contempt for similar comments made against members of the Supreme Court during the Election Petition hearing. Dr. Ayine apologized profusely when he appeared before the Court on the Contempt charge and admitted to having made comments which were unbecoming of a Lawyer of his standing and a former Deputy Attorney-General."
Dr. Ayine, in his eleven-paged response to the CJ's complaint, is insisting that his comments did not attack the reputation of the justices who sat on the election petition case.
He insists that his comments were in good faith.
“As I have stated in this response, as a lawyer, I have a special responsibility to engage in criticism of the work of the judiciary. By reason of my training and experience, I am better placed than most of my fellow citizens to point out deficiencies in judgments and in the performance by the judiciary of its core constitutional mandate.”
He further posited that his comments were within the confines of fair and temperate speech.
The main opposition political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) at a press conference in Accra on Monday asked the Chief Justice to withdraw his disciplinary complaint against Dr Ayine.
Disagreeing with positions that the Chief Justice should withdraw the complaint and that he has no locus to file such a complaint, Mr Ndebugre said Dr Ayine was not talking about an individual member of the panel or the members of the panel who were just seven. He wasn't talking about combination of them. He talked about the whole judiciary and the Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and therefore he was the proper person to lay the complaint.
Speaking in a radio interview monitored by Graphic Online on Accra based Citi FM on Tuesday evening (June 22, 2021), Mr Ndebugre said: "I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint."
Comparing that to what happened in 1996 - the Republic against Mensah Bonsu, Stephen Quarcoo and Tommy Thompson - in that case Mensah Bonsu attacked an individual judge, Justice Abban and therefore he made the complaint and then the Attorney-General took it up from there and prosecuted the matter on behalf of the judiciary or the court.
No problem about CJ filing complaint
"So I think that there is no problem about the Chief Justice laying the complaint.
The other matter is that, Dominic Ayine was Deputy Attorney-General, and he and his boss at that time took people to the criminal court, proceeding to the civil court... so if the Attorney-General approves the prosecution of a person, can somebody say that no, the person was expressing freedom of speech... therefore he should not be sent to court. 
No, you are to go to the court and make your case, and state your case, and say that you were not guilty of the offence charged. 
So in the same measure, the Chief Justice thinks that the statement was untoward so far as the independence of the judiciary is concerned. 
So you go there, all those arguments that are being bandied about now, both by the NDC and Dr Ayine himself are matters that should be at the Disciplinary Committee," Mr Ndebugre added.
Insisting that he does not want to discuss the merits, he maintained that there are two forms, it is like contempt, whiles the matter is still pending, which is you are interfering with the administration of justice if you make prejudicial statements whiles the case is still pending, then after the judgment has been given and you make statements that scandalise the courts, you can be pursued for that.
If you lose a case in court, you can say that you don't agree, "but to say that... I say that I don't want to discuss the merits, all I'm doing now is that I don't agree with the position that because in the view of the political party, he [Dr Ayine] was expressing his right to free expression and therefore the matter should not be pursued. I don't agree."
"The point is that you must go to the Disciplinary Committee and state there that you were exercising your right to free expression, but you cannot say that the Chief Justice cannot make a complaint, he is the head of the judiciary, and you say your confidence in the judiciary has been dampened because of the way the case was handled. So he should go there [GLC], and point out those aspects of the handling of the case that led him to the conclusion that the judiciary in Ghana is not independent."
Asked about the notion that the Chief Justice chairs the GLC and therefore the Disciplinary Committee, is a sub-committee of his court and therefore he was sending Ayine to his own "court" to be tried, Mr Ndebugre replied, "are you saying that those who constitute the Disciplinary Committee are robots, and that they are going to take instructions from the Chief Justice. When you do these things, you don't help the development of our democracy. Freedom of speech does not mean that you can just say whatever you like."
He used the Parliamentary Disciplinary Committee where the legislature has been dragging people there, "have those people not been expressing their views or expressing their rights to free speech. If you go and say that errh! Parliamentarians are all corrupt without any evidence, you will be dragged to Privileges Committee... why are you saying that you cannot be questioned in another forum?
"I'm not saying that the Chief Justice is right or wrong. 
All I'm saying is that the Chief Justice has made a complaint, as far as I am concerned he is the right person to make the complaint because the statement was against the judiciary, the independence of the judiciary, and he is the head of the judiciary and he has to come forward with a complaint. 
The complaint doesn't mean that you have been condemned, you are to go there and make all the arguments that you are making with press conferences and so on, and then the matter will be determined. 
It is only when you go there and there is evidence of bias, that you can start complaining but I think at this stage, it is premature and I'll advise Ayine to try and go to the Disciplinary Committee and make his case, it is in their interest for them to go and prove the Chief Justice wrong."
The National Peace Council (NPC) has initiated measures to deepen national unity by tackling the polarisation of the country in the aftermath of last year’s general election.
According to the council, political polarisation was a major issue that had the potential to bring about a crisis situation, hence the need to nip it in the bud.
The NPC said this at a dialogue for political parties and other stakeholders in Ada in the Greater Accra Region.
The dialogue, dubbed: “Countering post-2020 election violence and building consensus for greater political tolerance in Ghana”, was supported by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The objective was to build concensus among stakeholders to strengthen mechanisms for greater national cohesion, political tolerance, peace and nation-building.
Participants included the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Rt Hon. Patricia Scotland; the UNDP Resident Representative, Dr Angela Lusigi; the ministers of Information, Mr Kojo Oppong Nkrumah; the Interior, Mr Ambrose Dery, and National Security, Mr Albert Kan-Dapaah.
Others were a Deputy Chairperson of the Electoral Commission, Dr Eric Bossman Asare; a representative of the Inspector-General of Police, some executive members of the National Democratic Congress, the New Patriotic Party, the Convention People's Party, faith-based organisations, traditional rulers and civil society organisations.
Mr Dery said notwithstanding the security strategies that were put in place ahead of the December general election, there were still some pockets of violent incidents which claimed some lives and led to the destruction to property.
He said 32 violent incidents were recorded by the police in five constituencies across the country, out of which six persons died.
Mr Dery said the government would not relent in its effort to get those behind the disturbances to face prosecution.
For his part, Mr Kan-Dapaah said political tolerance and consensus building remained critical ingredients for the social, economic and political advancement of the country.
The Rt Hon. Scotland commended the people of Ghana for the peaceful manner in which they engaged in political discourse in the country, which she said was acknowledged by the entire Commonwealth family.
According to her, Ghana had historically led the way in democracy, which she said was "a heavy burden on the people’s shoulders, but it’s a burden that the people have carried with pride. We have always hoped in Ghana".
She, however, called for the inclusion of more women and the youth in policy formulation in the country.
The Chairman of the NPC, Rev. Dr Ernest Adu-Gyamfi, said his outfit was working at strengthening mechanisms for inter- and intra-party dialogue to deepen trust and confidence in key state institutions responsible for elections.
He expressed the hope that the issues discussed would significantly contribute to the healing of wounds created in the aftermath of the 2020 elections.
The Chief Servant of Transeco Minerals and Mining, Mr. Godwin Amarh has constructed a six-unit classroom block at Akyem Ampapatia in the Atiwa West District of the Eastern Region.
The classroom block, estimated at a cost of GH¢295,000 forms part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
Speaking at the inauguration, Mr Amarh underscored the need to give good and quality education to children at lower levels as it helps to give them strong foundation in education.
He said the role of education in every country’s development cannot be undermined, hence the reason his company prioritizes education.
“We at Transeco Mining and Minerals Company have decided to ensure that children in communities where we operate are exposed to the best of teaching and learning environments at the lower levels of education. That is why we have made education a top priority on our corporate social responsibility.
I’m excited to be back at Ampapatia to commission this school. We all know how important education is to the growth of individuals and the country. In order to have brilliant students at higher levels of education, they must first have a strong foundation that is why we have built this Kindergarten”, he said.
Mr. Amarh said the school is also an appreciation to the chiefs and people of Ampapatia who have maintained a healthy relationship with the company since they started their operations in the community.
Contrary to rumors and wild speculations that government has placed a ban on mining activities in the country, Mr. Amarh debunked the rumours and described it as not just inaccurate but false.
According to him, government has rather introduced new measures, policies and programmes aimed at making small scale mining productive and not destructive.
“Government has not banned activities of miners but rather categorized areas close to water bodies and forest reserves as red zones where no individual or company should mine. So what government is saying is that small scale miners should move away from the red zones. So anyone who does contrary to the directive by government will be dealt with by the laws of the country”, Mr. Amarh said.
He therefore advised small scale miners to go work but ensure that they mine at designated areas.
Mr. Amarh who also doubles as the General Secretary of the Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners (GNASSM) admonished members of the group to impact positively on communities where they have concessions.
He said small scale miners must work to change the narrative that they are destroyers who only take from communities and give nothing back.
He said although many small scale miners are already doing that, there remains more to be done.
“Our sector employs a lot of people in communities where we operate. We must therefore work assiduously to leave a footprint. I know a lot of our members who have built schools and others have helped communities get electricity. We must push those stories out there to change the narrative that small scale miners only destroy’, he advised.
The Rebecca Foundation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Abdul Samad Rabiu Africa Initiative (ASR Africa) for a grant of $500,000.
The grant will be drawn from ASR Africa’s annual $100 million Africa Fund for Social Development and Renewal to support the Rebecca Foundation’s education initiative.
Speaking at the meeting, the Managing Director of ASR Africa, Mr Ubon Udoh, commended the foundation for its commitment to the welfare of women and children in the country.
He also praised the foundation for its adherence to good corporate governance and practices which have enabled the foundation to deliver infrastructure and services in the areas of education, health and women’s economic empowerment.
"We did our homework and identified the Rebecca Foundation as one of the most reputable charities in Ghana, which encouraged ASR Africa to support the Rebecca Foundation.” he said.
The Executive Director of the Foundation, Mrs Rebecca Akufo-Addo, thanked ASR Africa for the support to the foundation.
She pledged the commitment of the foundation to utilise the grant to benefit the education of children in the country.
The UK has denied involvement in the arrest and extradition of Nnamdi Kanu, who leads a banned group seeking a breakaway state in south-eastern Nigeria, where the ethnic Igbo people form the majority.
Mr Kanu, who holds British and Nigerian citizenship, was detained on Sunday with the help of Interpol and flown back to Nigeria, according to the attorney general.
He faces treason-related charges in Nigeria, but fled the country in 2017 while on bail.
There has been speculation that he might have been arrested in the UK, where it is believed he was mainly based.
“We can confirm that Nnamdi Kanu was not arrested in the UK for extradition purposes,’’ a British High Commission spokesperson told the BBC.
He is currently in the custody of Nigeria’s secret police after a brief court appearance on Tuesday.
His trial is expected to resume on 26 July.
The 53-year-old came to prominence in 2009 when he started Radio Biafra and broadcast to Nigeria from London, using the platform to call for Biafran independence and urging his followers to take up arms against the Nigerian state.
Five years later, he founded the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), which has since been labelled a terrorist organisation by the Nigerian authorities.
Mr Kanu's initial arrest in 2015 triggered massive protests.
I was excited when I saw the Independence Square being renovated late last year.
The renovation, comprising painting and concrete works, was meant to prepare the Square for the funeral rites of former President Jerry John Rawlings.
The Institute of Directors-Ghana (IoD-Gh) has commended the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for taking significant steps to promote good corporate governance in the country.
It has also called for stronger collaboration between the institute and the bank to help promote proper governance of companies in the country.
During a courtesy by the institute on the management of BoG, the President of IoD-Gh, Mr Rockson Kwesi Dogbegah, eulogised the Governor of the central bank, Dr Ernest Addison, for providing transformational leadership in reforming the financial services sector.
He said the effort by BoG led by Dr Addison had led to a vibrant and resilient banking sector.
A statement from the institute said the visit was to commend the bank for its significant role in promoting the culture of good corporate governance in Ghana and to seek mutually beneficial relationships between BoG and the institute.
Speaking on the strategic projects of the IoD-Gh, Mr Dogbegah said the IoD-Gh is developing a charter aimed at setting standards for the practice of corporate governance in Ghana.
He indicated that the development of a national governance code was another key strategic project to be undertaken by the institute.
He disclosed that the institute had established the ongoing annual corporate governance excellence awards as part of its strategic efforts to celebrate the achievements of outstanding individual personalities and corporate organisations that have represented excellence in leadership and corporate governance and have made significant contributions to the socioeconomic development of Ghana.
He added that the Institute, working in collaboration with key stakeholders, had championed the formation of the Ghana Association of Integrated Thinking and Reporting aimed at stimulating a strategic and sustainable way of value creation and reporting by organisations.
BoG Governor stated that corporate governance played an important role in the financial sector.
According to him, corporate governance breaches, overbearing shareholder behaviour and related-party transactional breaches as some of the factors that led to the failure of some banks in the financial sector and their consequent resolution.
He reiterated the need for the Ghanaian society to uphold good corporate governance practices and pledged the bank’s support for the work of the institute, especially as events in the banking sector have a rippling effect on the Ghanaian economic sector.
Arteta must deliver next season
As I have already mentioned, Arsenal do not intend to sack Mikel Arteta and the club management will back him to turn the Gunners around next season.
No one can say for certain if Arsenal have made the right decision but the club intends to bring in more talented players this summer.
Serious questions are being asked about the manager’s ability and even in his own dressing room players are looking at him and wondering if he is the right man for the job.
At 39 years-of-age Arteta has a reputation, built alongside Pep Guardiola, as a brilliant coach.
However, after seventeen months in charge the fortunes of Arsenal have not progressed and many would argue that the team performances are inferior to those of Unai Emery, the man he replaced and who knocked him out of the Europa League.
Arteta captained Arsenal and was welcomed by the fans as their new champion but they are getting restless and agitated as they watch Chelsea and Tottenham move further ahead.
The Super League disaster will not be forgotten for a long time
but I can tell you that the Kroenke owners are going nowhere
so it is up to Arteta to mend bridges, build a strong team and get his tactics right next season otherwise the proud Gunners could well crash and burn.
De Gea won’t accept being No2
Despite Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea having a contract until 2023 his agents are testing the waters to see which clubs would be interested in signing him.
I am hearing from inside Old Trafford that despite being on good terms with current No1 Dean Henderson, De Gea will not sit back and accept a role on the bench for much longer.
I am picking up interest from Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid.
The 30-year-old is arguably at the peak of his career although some inside the club believe he has declined slightly over the past two years.
Manager Solskjaer said, “Goalkeeper departments are a very tight knit group.
They work in preparation, they have different gym sessions, individual sessions to the rest of the squad and they stay together more.
Naturally they create a bond and the spirit in the goalkeeping department has been top.
It’s a healthy competition.”
I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesn’t regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games, I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford.
I take West Brom to bounce back yet again
After one season back in the Premier League we again say goodbye to West Bromwich Albion.
The key to yet another quick bounce back from the Championship will be whether or not fire-fighting manager Sam Allardyce can be persuaded to stay.
He is disappointed to have lost his reputation as never having been relegated with any club and the board at West Brom have a lot of work to do if they want to keep him.
Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Conor Gallagher and Okay Yokuslu will return to their parent clubs after being on loan but Matheus Pereira, Callum Robinson, Hal Robson-Kanu and Karlan Grant can impress in the lower league.
Fastest man at City
Who is the fastest player in the Manchester City squad?
No, it isn’t Raheem Sterling.
Manager Pep Guardiola set up a practice whereby each player had to control the ball and sprint 10 yards.
There are some very fast movers in the City squad but Gabriel Jesus proved he was the fastest.
The best is yet to come from Havertz
Thomas Tuchel has been singing the praises of Kai Havertz and pointed to his two goals recently scored against Fulham.
Tuchel recognises that since Kai arrived at Stamford Bridge from Bayer Leverkusen, things have not gone well for the German.
Moving from a foreign country and having to handle lockdown restrictions made things difficult and of course he caught Covid-19 and had to battle back to fitness.
The upcoming Champions League final and the next pre-season, Tuchel believes, will show the best of the attacking midfielder and forward.
Solskjaer is turning United into winners again
Manchester United might have big problems with the fans actively showing aggression  towards the owners but inside the club there is a new belief, a new harmony and renewed confidence that they can achieve.
The man responsible is Ole Gunner Solskjaer and after speaking with many United staff and supporters this week, everyone recognises that it is time to praise the manager for achieving so much in the last eighteen months.
Solskjaer paved the way to sign Bruno Fernandes and Edinson Cavani and both have proven to be excellent additions to United’s line-up.
Cavani has confirmed that he is staying for another season and it is mainly his belief in Solskjaer which has persuaded him.
Paul Pogba looks settled and happy and his relationship with the manager is at an all-time high.
When United fall behind in a matches these days, they get back up, fight and more often than not they win.
There is one thing to thank out-going Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward for and that is allowing Solskjaer time to succeed in the job, survive the rough patches and turn his players into winners.
Solskjaer is now the most important and the strongest foundation brick of the revitalised United and critics, staff and fans believe this is the beginning of a golden era for the Reds.
Tell-tale sign
Kane thinking about leaving
I noticed a significant silence during the match against Leeds at the weekend.
Harry Kane usually runs as much, if not more, than any other player and constantly barks out orders and instructions to other players to play more effectively.
Against Leeds he was very quiet and more so than I think I have ever seen him.
I suspect this is a tell-tale sign that Harry is seriously doubting his tenure at Spurs and is already looking for a way out.
Wolves desperate for a striker
Nuno Espirito Santos has at last recognised that during the transfer window he must prioritise signing a new striker.
Winger Pedro Neto and midfielder Ruben Neves are the leading scorers which pinpoints the weakness in Wolves strike force.
Fabio Silva and Raul Jimenez are next on the list however Jimenez has been out of action since November after fracturing his skull.
Wolves have 13 goals less this season than last year.
The Wolves board have promised Nuno money to sign a proven goalscorer.
Jimenez by the way will be told on May 18th if he is medically safe to play in the final two games of this season.
He has been training for two months but was banned from heading the ball and having physical contact with his teammates.
Sir Alex praises McTominay
When the great Sir Alex Ferguson speaks about Manchester United he is always worth listening to.
His admiration for Scott McTominay is immense and the master says the midfielder should automatically play in every United game.
“Scott McTominay is now emerging as one of United’s big players,” Sir Alex said.
“When you watch United pick their team for an important game, McTominay’s name is in it.
He’s a good character and a great trainer.
I signed him when he was just a kid of seven or eight years of age
and he was actually a centre-forward.”
What higher praise can a player receive.
Three astonishing football facts…
*Manchester United have not lost an away game in the PL for a year and four months!
*If they do not win their next game, Sheffield United will become the first team since the 1904-05 season to have gone without winning two consecutive games.
Dr Madzorera said the health ministry should also raise awareness about the disease, as well as make phone calls in all parts of the country so that people can call at any time to talk about the disease.
They are also advocating for hygienic hygiene check-ups, rather than waiting for a suspected antibody to take them to the hospital.
Caps United chairman Lewis Uriri says they have resolved the problems facing their club and the striking players have begun preparations for their Castle Premier Soccer League matches.
Speaking to Studio 7, Uriri said the players were given their outstanding bonus money.
But he said last month's salaries would be paid to players soon. He also mentioned that there were some unnamed people who were influencing Caps United players to stop playing football.
Uriri said he had spoken to the players and also said the reason for the delay in paying the players was that things were difficult for everyone in the country and that the real government had not paid last year's bonuses.
Sexual rights activists say abortion laws need to be amended to keep up with the times and to protect the lives of girls and women.
Sayendisa Ndlovu of SayWhat says the public is unaware of the abortion law and says it is important for the government to publicize the law.
Ndlovu told Studio 7 that it was important to amend the law as it was written long ago. He said the law needed to be amended to add other factors that could lead to a miscarriage.
Ndlovu said such factors as mental illness, HIV / AIDS or disability were some of the factors that could be considered for abortion.
Ndlovu also explained that the law as it stands does not limit public hospitals to public abortion services and did not require a child nurse or doctor to abort a person legally.
Ms. Tendaishe Changamire, a civil rights activist under the Right Here Right Now program, has also called for the law to be amended to increase the risk of abortion.
Ms. Changamire says many studies show that young girls are losing their lives through abortions.
Although many young people are pushing for the law to be amended, some older women are opposed to it, saying abortion law should not make abortion more acceptable, saying it will make young people less respectful of life.
The Termination of Pregnancy Act was enacted by a parliament in 1977 before the country gained full independence.
Police have arrested several members of the MDC-T led by Nelson Chamisa as they tried to enter the party's Harare headquarters at Morgan Tsvangirai House.
This came after the capture of the center by the MDC faction led by Ms Thokozani Khupe.
Ms Khupe has been declared by the Supreme Court to hold office following Morgan Tsvangirai's death two years ago.
Police in custody include Chamisa's two deputies, Tendai Biti and Lynett Karenyi Kore, as well as David Chimhini, Lovemore Chinoputsa, Gladys Hlatywayo and others.
The detainees were said to be on their way to the party's headquarters, where they were surrounded by armed police.
Studio7 has not been able to hear from the police how many people have been arrested, and what charges have been leveled against them as police spokesman Paul Nyathi was not answering his phone.
Chamisa's MDC spokesperson, Fadzai Mahere, said he was shocked by the arrests.
The situation in the MDC is tense following a Supreme Court ruling this year that ruled that Chamisa and Ms Khupe's congresses were unconstitutional, and that Congress should be held at a time when Ms Khupe is the caretaker incumbent.
Following the ruling, Ms Khupe fired four members of parliament and the senate, saying the people were no longer representing the interests of their party.
Dismissed are Thabitha Khumalo, Prosper Mutseyami, Lilian Timveous and Charlton Hwende.
Some Zimbabweans in various countries say they were forced to leave the country because of the rule of Robert Mugabe, who they say is ruling with an ax.
A political scientist who teaches at Bergen University in Norway, and a member of the Zimbabwe Yibuya / Mayibuye Zimbabwe organization, Dr Victor Chimhutu, says that although Mr Mugabe was seen as a champion of African unity, one Zimbabwean family did not view him that way.
Dr Chimhutu says Mr Mugabe's alliance with other African leaders is one of the reasons he has gained so much respect from African leaders.
They say Mr. Mugabe will also be remembered for insulting and expressing his views on the West and his criticism of the leaders of countries such as the United States and Britain.
Mr Mugabe allegedly did not beat the dogs and hid the culprit if members of his Zanu PF party defected, or even insulted opposition parties.
Mr Mugabe is expected to be laid to rest on Sunday, although his whereabouts have not yet been announced.
Doctors and nurses working in public hospitals have told the government they will stop working at the beginning of next month if they are not paid before the end of December.
The president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Fortune Nyamande, who said his organization was affiliated with the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, had written a letter to the government informing them of the move.
Dr Nyamande said he had written to the government informing him of his strike from January 1 next year.
They say they and nurses in government hospitals have taken this step on the grounds of lack of transportation costs as they have not yet received their monthly salaries as well as bonus payments promised by the government.
Dr Nyamande also criticized the government's alleged use of the media to discredit traditional newspapers.
Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has already announced that the government will not be able to pay some of its employees this year due to a lack of funds.
"Mr Chinamasa has used the newspapers to announce the change in our pay dates, so we will use the same methods," Dr Nyamande said.
The coaches, who were due to receive their pay on Monday, have been announced on Tuesday, but the general public, including doctors and nurses, are expected to receive their pay on January 5 next year.
But many civil servants who spoke to Studio 7 said they were not confident they would get their money back on the new deadlines.
We have not been able to contact the Minister of Health, David Parirenyatwa, and the Minister of Labor, Priscah Mupfumira, to find out what steps they will take to prevent a strike.
The main opposition MDC party has complained that its members are being harassed by the police.
The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights says 47 people have been arrested in recent days, mostly MDC supporters and seven other students at Allen Wilson School in Harare for allegedly protesting illegally.
Other detainees include Makomborero Haruzivishe, a former student leader from ZINASU, who appeared in court today, along with his colleague Allan Moyo.
We were unable to reach the police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, as their phone was unanswered.
Lawyer Innocent Gonese, the MDC's legal adviser, said Haruzivishe and Moyo would return to court on Monday to discuss the court's decision.
The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has declared China that the corona virus, which has killed 233 people in China, has become a global epidemic.
In the last two days alone, about 2,000 people are estimated to have been infected with the corona virus and 9,800 have been infected worldwide in 244 countries.
WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while they were confident of China's efforts to prevent the disease, they feared that if it spread to other parts of the world, it could kill more people.
Health Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo says Zimbabwe is testing more than 200 people from China or countries with a corona virus infection.
People under investigation in Zimbabwe are being held at their home for 14 days.
Former health minister Dr Henry Madzorera says Zimbabwe needs more money to prevent the spread of the disease.
The body of former president Robert Mugabe will arrive in Harare on Wednesday afternoon and his funeral will be announced.
This was announced by the Minister of Information, Ms Monica Mutsvangwa, after a cabinet meeting.
Ms Mutsvangwa said government committees were preparing for Mr Mugabe's funeral.
Asked why it was taking so long to talk about Mugabe's funeral, Mutsvangwa and Foreign Affairs Minister Sibusiso Moyo said it was "unusual" that he would announce his funeral arrangements after the Mugabe family in Singapore arrived in the country.
He said the government and President Mugabe's family were working together.
Meanwhile, King Katizagombo's spokesman, Gibson Jenami, said there was no longer any controversy over Mugabe's funeral as the government, led by Emmerson Mnangagwa, was at the forefront of the process.
Meanwhile, Major General Trust Mugoba, who also passed away last week, will be laid to rest on Wednesday at the Heroes Acre burial ground in Harare.
In other news, the government says 178 Zimbabweans have been affected by the violence in South Africa and that two Zimbabweans have died in the violence.
Moyo said the government was planning to bring the victims home with the bodies.
The government also claims that health workers, including doctors, have been paid an additional 60 percent of their benefits, and today the cabinet has decided that the health and finance ministry will sit down to ensure that the workers are paid fairly.
Health Minister, Dr Obadiah Moyo, has said he will sit down with the finance ministry to ensure that the cabinet resolution is implemented.
Doctors went on strike last week complaining that their salaries were too low.
An organization formed to commemorate human rights activists and former Occupy Africa Unity Square leader Itai Dzamara, the Itai Dzamara Trust, today celebrated International Women's Day.
The ceremony was held in Highfield where women and girls who attended the event were provided with follow-up equipment or sanitary pads and more.
A spokesman for the Dzamara family who is also a member of the board of the Itai Dzamara Trust, Mr Partson Dzamara, told Studio 7 that he saw fit to show love to women this month, the month of his brother Itai's disappearance five years ago.
He said although his brother was involved in politics, human rights and journalism, he did it all out of love and the Itai Dzamara Trust will continue to be kind to him.
He said his organization had launched its operation in the village of Highfields because it was the birthplace of Itai but said they would go elsewhere to help women and the poor with knowledge and experience in many areas including law, education and health.
Among the participants in today's event was Rememberance Zuze, who said that although Mr Dzamara had not yet been found, he was happy with the actions of the organization that monitors his life.
An unnamed girl told Studio 7 that she has benefited a lot today.
Meanwhile, Partson Dzamara has announced that a five-year anniversary rally for his brother abducted by unknown individuals in Glen View will be held on Tuesday in Harare.
He said so far they did not know the whereabouts of his brother or whether he was alive.
He said police, human rights activists, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission and others who worked with Itai Dzamara were among those invited to the event.
As the world celebrates refugee day, tomorrow, some Zimbabweans living as refugees in South Africa say there is nothing to celebrate as South Africa is in dire straits.
Some Zimbabweans say South Africa does not respect the agreements it has signed with organizations such as the United Nations in respecting the rights of refugees.
The secretary general of the Zimbabwe Migrant Support Network, Shelton Chiyangwa, told Studio 7 that although refugee day is important, South African refugees are being held hostage.
Chiyangwa said the Zimbabwean family living in South Africa was also the main victims.
He added that his organization was working with Zimbabweans and other countries to help them obtain travel documents
Zimbabwe Exemption Permits vice-chairwoman Gladys Mangwende said her organization was interested in the refugee awareness program but was concerned about the lack of human rights.
The chairman of Human Rights Watch in North Africa, Dewa Mavhinga, says refugee day is important in South Africa as there are many Zimbabweans living as refugees.
Mr Mavhinga went on to urge the South African government to relax the rules, especially in the area of ​​immigration.
Another Zimbabwean, George Manyika, also backed Mavhinga's statement.
Gabriel Shumba, head of the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum, has called on the United Nations, the AU and SADC to take a closer look at the treatment of refugees by SA, especially Zimbabweans.
The Lions also appealed to South Africa's interior minister, Aaron Motseledi, to relax his department's rules so that refugees do not have to struggle to obtain documents.
He urged human rights groups to work with his organization to fight for the rights of all refugees.
One of the refugees, Francis Mukono, said he did not see the importance of refugee day as the situation in South Africa was difficult.
Another refugee, Steven Chiweshe, also said he was unaware of the stabbing.
Mandela Madumise, South Africa's director general of refugee affairs, said his department had applied to the United Nations Human Rights Council for assistance in resolving the problems they were facing in the department.
Madumise said by the end of next month, his department would know what needs to be done to address these issues.
It is estimated that more than three million Zimbabweans have fled South Africa to South Africa, accusing the government of harassment.
But the Zimbabwean government says some people have fled to the countryside in search of better pastures.
Hospital staff, including nurses and doctors, have been on strike for more than 33 days, saying their salaries were not enough to go to work without any hope of a solution.
The situation in public hospitals is tense, with some patients being sent home without treatment.
The situation in hospitals is expected to worsen as the Senior Health Doctors Association has already announced that if the financial issues and strikes of the junior and senior doctors are not resolved by them they will also go on strike. Spokesman for the medical association Dr Aaron Musara told Studio 7 that things were not going well in the hospitals.
Dr Musara said although he had informed the government of his intention to step down through letters to various departments, he had not received a response.
Nurses in public hospitals are not going to work and are demanding that the government pay them their salaries with the US money they received in October 2018 as well as provide them with equipment to protect themselves from illness when they are on duty.
The president of the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, ZINA, Enock Dongo, says talks with the government are a goat's head.
Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA) spokesperson Dr Tapiwa Mungofa also said that the lack of access to health care services by the government has left patients without treatment.
Mr Mungofa also said that at the time the children's nurses went on strike, many of their members were at home as a precautionary measure against the transmission of COVID-19 to self quarantine.
Studio 7 was unable to hear the government's side of the story to address the grievances of health workers as former health minister Professor Amon Murwira was unresponsive to his phone call.
But last week, Mr Murwira announced that he had started a conversation with a nurse. His deputy John Mangwiro also told Studio 7 that they were too busy to speak.
Chairman of the Health Services Board, Dr. Paulinus Sikosana, also said they had been in a meeting on the COVID-19 epidemic and were therefore unable to speak to us.
Health experts also say that if the government does not address the issue of nurses returning to work and also preventing pediatricians from continuing to set themselves on fire, especially now that the country is facing the COVID-19 epidemic that has killed 25 people so far.
Chinhoyi City Council says it is ready to comply with the High Court's ruling on Monday that the council should rebuild buildings that it demolished in the city.
Speaking at a meeting with traders who had their buildings demolished by the Chinhoyi council, the council's secretary, Abel Gotora, said they would abide by the court's order for the council to build commercial buildings which had been demolished by some traders.
But Mr Gotora said the council would not rebuild all the buildings it had demolished, but would only build the buildings that the high court had ordered for the six people who took the council to court.
Tafadzwa Marimo, Emmanuel Ngwaru, Richard Svosve, Pepukayi Marega and Devis Shopo were among those who took Chinhoyi to court.
One of the six, Emmanuel Gwaru, said he accepted the court ruling with great joy as the government had told the councils to clean up the area only, not demolish buildings.
Mr Gwaru said one of his biggest grievances was that he was paying money for the council to build better commercial facilities. Gadzema Councilor Patricia Chibaya said she was pleased with the court's decision as she was in a difficult situation because, on the other hand, as a councilor, she had to comply with a letter from provincial minister July Moyo to clean up the cities, but at the same time. they also sympathize with the people who live by the trade whose markets have been destroyed.
Mr Gotora announced that the council would build a new market for 50 traders at the Gadzema market.
A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Kumbirai Mafunda, said traffickers were coming to their offices seeking legal representation.
Many councils in the country are demolishing buildings that they say were built illegally.
But traders in various parts of the world are protesting in court what their councils are doing.
Following the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday as to who should lead the MDC party since the death of Morgan Tsvangirai, many people want to know who the real owner of the Richard Morgan Tsvangirai House or Harvest House is.
The court ruled that Ms Thokozani Khupe should take over the reins of the MDC-T until an election is held within three months.
But the issue of who enters the party's headquarters is a bit difficult as there are two people guarding the building, namely Ian Makone and Reverend Tim Neil, a former head of the Church of the Province of Central Africa or CPCA.
The secretary general of the MDC Alliance, Charlton Hwende, believes that the center is in the hands of the two and that they are currently the only ones allowed to use it.
Douglas Mwonzora, who also claims to be the party's secretary general, has returned to the party in 2014. He also believes that the party is in the hands of Makone and Neil.
But they said they think they will be allowed to work in you. We have not been able to contact Mr. Makone and Mr. Niel to hear their side of the story.
The deputy chairperson of the MDC led by Nelson Chamisa, Job Sikhala, says the St Marys area in Chitungwiza has given birth to leopards which is prompting party supporters to flee their homes and seek refuge.
Sikhala, a former Zengeza West MP, said his party's supporters were being sought by a senior police officer named Jabangwe in the area for his arrest.
We tried to contact Mr. Jabangwe but he did not want to answer our questions.
Studio7 was also unable to hear from a police spokesman. Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, why the supporters want to be arrested by the police.
But it is alleged that the issue of arrests of MDC supporters was aimed at protesting the party's nationwide protests.
Sikhala, who was arrested last month on charges of plotting to overthrow the government of Emmerson Mnangagwa, told Studio 7 that many people were fleeing their homes for fear of arrest.
More than 90 people were arrested in Harare last Friday in connection with a protest organized by the MDC on the same day.
The MDC wants to protest in major cities in the country but the police are using part of the Public Order and Security Act to ban the party from continuing its protests.
Police have so far banned the MDC from protesting in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru and Masvingo.
Political analysts say this could also happen in Mutare where the MDC plans to hold a protest on Thursday.
The High Court has suspended Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi and Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube from funding the MDC-T led by Thokozani Khupe under a parliamentary budget law.
High Court Judge Priscilla Munangati Manongwa ruled on Thursday that she had suspended Ziyambi and Ncube from presenting the MDC-T faction, which claims to be the legitimate party, to fund political parties under parliament under the Political Parties (Finance) Act.
The MDC is due to receive R7,500 million in RTGS.
Experts say Nelson Chamisa's MDC has gone to court after Ms Khupe's faction had written letters to banks seeking to remove Chamisa's members from the list of people who were required to sign statements to withdraw money from the party's Steward Bank.
Chamisa's MDC-T deputy spokesman, Luke Tamborinyoka, said he was happy with the ruling.
But Morgen Komichi, who has been claiming to be the party's chairman following a Supreme Court ruling that ruled that Chamisa had not complied with his party's constitution to become MDC leader, said he would take steps to get the money as he was the party's official leader.
But Mr Tamborinyoka said he was entitled to the money as the MDC MPs entered parliament using his name.
But Komichi said Mr Chamisa and others should abide by the law.
Meanwhile, a Harare lawyer, Kudzai Kadzere, said the court's decision could be appealed within 10 days.
Ziyambi told Studio7 by telephone that they could also file their papers in court within 10 days if they want to challenge the ruling as ordered by the court.
We have not been able to speak to the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, or the Minister of Finance to hear his side of the story as he has also been named in the court papers.
Some legal experts say the provisional order was issued by the court to the nominees that if they did not object to Chamisa's MDC case, the court could fulfill its decision to transfer the money to Chamisa's MDC.
This is not the first time the MDC has fought for these funds.
In 2006, after former MDC secretary general Welshman Ncube opposed Morgan Tsvangirai in October 2005 and formed his own MDC, he continued to receive all the MDC funding for the parties, leaving Mr. Tsvangirai, the majority party in parliament, without a single penny.
Another Zimbabwean, Dr Rita Nyampinga, of the Female Prisoners Support Trust, which fights for women's rights in prisons, said she was happy to receive the 2020 International Women of Courage Award.
The award recognizes the heroic deeds of women around the world, and is presented by the United States Department of International Relations.
Dr Nyampinga said she never thought she would receive such an honor, saying she was thrilled to be recognized along with 11 other women from around the world.
Dr Nyampinga says they will be traveling to various parts of the United States to learn about prison conditions so that they can strengthen their work at home.
Dr Nyampinga says their work requires courage and they are happy that others have seen the work they are doing back home.
Speaking at the event, Secretary of State for International Relations Michael Pompeo said the work done by the 12 women is admirable and requires courage.
The program was launched 14 years ago.
Other women who have received this award are from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Burkino Faso, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen and Zimbabwe.
Mr Pompey said such programs were important as they gave women the opportunity to work for the rights of others around the world.
Speaking at the event, the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump, said she was pleased with the human rights work being done by women around the world.
He said that since they first met the women who have been selected for recognition four years ago, they have continued to meet women who are doing admirable work around the world even though some of them do these jobs and face harassment but continue to do so.
Dr Nyampinga says he started his career as a human rights activist 30 years ago.
In addition to her party, Ms Nyampinga is a board member of the Women's Coalition Of Zimbabwe, Crisis In Zimbabwe Coalition, Women Academy on Political Leadership Excellence and Women And Aids Support Network.
Other Zimbabwean women who have received the award include Ms. Jenni Willaims, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, Ms. Jestina Mukoko and Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa.
The health ministry said it had asked South Africa to test whether a Zimbabwean woman from China arrived in the country on Tuesday with a coronavirus infection.
A study conducted in Zimbabwe by China shows that it does not. South Africa's National Institute of Communicable Diseases has the highest level of expertise in northern South Africa to determine if a person has been infected with the coronavirus.
The woman is at Wilkins Hospital in Harare. Infectious disease specialist Dr Portia Manangazira says they expect to know the status of the situation within five days.
The ban on the operation of minibuses and buses under the ZUPCO bus company has caused problems for the lack of transportation, which has led to people gathering at bus stops as the country struggles to spread the Covid-19 epidemic in the country.
Many people are said to be suffering from a lack of transportation, especially in the evenings, which is causing them to squeeze into the few available buses.
The government has enacted a law banning passengers from transporting people during the Covid-19 epidemic as a way to prevent the spread of the virus, stating that only ZUPCO-owned buses are allowed to carry passengers.
But some buses and buses are said to be reluctant to go under the scheme for various reasons including delays in payment by ZUPCO.
On Monday, the private bus operators reportedly held a meeting with ZUPCO officials to try to resolve their grievances, including late payment of their buses.
On Tuesday, the buses were expected to meet with government officials to resolve the dispute.
Studio 7 has not been able to hear from ZUPCO as to what plans are in place to address the shortage of transport.
But the head of the Harare Residents Trust, Precious Shumba, said the government should address the transport crisis as soon as possible before things go awry.
Lions say the government should put police, army or council police at the bus stops in order to enforce a law to protect people from spreading the disease.
They also say that health workers should also be patrolling the bus terminals to check that they are HIV-negative or Covid-19.
Businesses in Bulawayo in conjunction with various city organizations have met with city officials to discuss problems they say are caused by water shortages, which are said to have taken a long time.
The head of the Association for Business in Zimbabwe (ABUZ), Victor Nyoni, said the closure had disrupted the operation of many businesses as their members needed water to carry out their daily activities.
Mr Nyoni said he had been assured by the council officials he met to expect water supply early next week, as the council hopes to complete its work by the end of the week.
The city of Bulawayo is said to have entered its second week without water following a move by the council to repair water pumps at the Criterion Water Works.
This is also said to be due to the declining water levels in the city's main source of water for Criterion and Magwegwe as well as power outages for pumping water.
Mr. Nyoni says it is well known that the city of Bulawayo is over 120 years old, and that machinery and water pipes are old.
He called on the government and the council to take steps to address the problem once and for all.
Studio7 failed to hear the council's side of the story.
The Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, which represents striking doctors, said it was waiting to hear from President Emmerson Mnangagwa after a meeting with its envoys on Wednesday.
The treasurer of the meeting, Doctor Prince Butau, said he was looking forward to hearing from Mr Mnangagwa any time on Thursday or Friday.
Mr Mnangagwa, who was on leave, returned immediately to try to resolve the doctors' strike.
Things in all public hospitals are said to be in a state of disarray since doctors went on strike on December 1 last year.
But the head of the Community Working Group on Health, Mr Itai Rusike, said the government should address the problem urgently and provide doctors with money to prevent them from picking ants by mouth.
Some Zimbabweans in South Africa have protested at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, where Deputy President Constantino Chiwenga is being treated, demanding that Chiwenga return to a local hospital for treatment.
Mr Chiwenga was reportedly rushed out of the country over the weekend for medical treatment in South Africa, although Studio 7 could not find any evidence that he was in South Africa's largest hospital.
Media Minister Monica Mutsvangwa and Information Secretary Nick Mangwana declined to comment on the matter on Sunday when contacted by VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe, urging them to arrest George Charamba.
But Studio 7 failed to contact Charamba to find out if it was true that Chiwenga was ill and was being treated at the hospital.
Another Zimbabwean, Carlos Chimbi, who lives in Cape Town, joined other Zimbabweans in the protest.
Chimbi said he was "deeply saddened" that the vice president had violated the rights of people with disabilities in the country as he knew he would seek medical treatment abroad if he became ill.
He said he was happy to be able to deliver his message to the hospital as the head of the hospital had asked to speak to him, although he did not say whether Mr Chiwenga was at the hospital or not.
Chimbi said the head of the hospital had told him that the law did not allow him to talk about patients who would be at the hospital if they were not at the hospital.
Chiwenga angered the people last year when doctors went on strike, saying they were not skilled workers but ordinary workers, and that the government had not taken steps to address the problems in hospitals that are causing people to lack proper treatment.
Groote Schurr Hospital is best known for being the world's first heart-to-heart transplant.
Police have banned the main opposition MDC party from holding a rally tomorrow when the party's leader, Nelson Chamisa, was expected to announce his party's direction and plans for this year.
Speaking after a meeting of the party's Standing Committee in Harare, MDC deputy spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka said police had banned the rally and said they were busy with the reopening of schools.
Tamborinyoka said the meeting would not be held tomorrow because the MDC wanted its supporters to avoid being beaten or attacked by the police.
He said it was clear that the police were trying to attack the party's supporters as they had done when the party planned to protest in all the cities and towns in the country.
He said the conference, which had the theme of Agenda 2020, was to be held at Ms Musodzi Hall in Mbare and would be held on Tuesday next week at a venue to be announced later.
Mr Tamborinyoka said the MDC was tired of being considered a terrorist organization and was considering whether to continue to follow the law or change its policy.
We were unable to hear from Zimbabwe Republic Police, ZRP spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi, as their mobile phone was not working.
Independent political analyst Masimba Kuchera told Studio7 that he felt the police were harassing the MDC.
In August last year, the ZRP banned the MDC from protesting in cities and towns across the country, saying it feared the protests would lead to riots as had happened in January.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Norway offers this award.
Ahmed was praised for bringing peace between his country and Eritrea after a 20-year war over differences between the two countries.
The first black person to win the award was Albert Luthuli of South Africa in 1960.
Other recipients include the late Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Anwar Sedat of Egypt and Kofi Annan of Ghana.
Other winners include, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, were Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the late Wangari Maathai of Kenya, the first black woman in Africa to win the award.
In Zimbabwe in 2011 the late Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai was nominated for a prize although he was unsuccessful.
Dr Pedzisayi Ruhanya, a political scientist at the University of Johannesburg, says President Emmerson Mnangagwa has a lot to learn from Ahmed's leadership style.
Many elephants and other animals are dying of starvation and water in the Hwange National Park, prompting the government to intensify its efforts to reduce the number of elephants.
During a visit to Studio7 in the Hwange National Park area, we saw the bodies of many elephants who have died of malnutrition caused by drought in some areas this year.
Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) spokesperson Tinashe Farawo told Studio7 that 85 elephants have died since September and more than 200 have died this year due to starvation.
The Pharaohs also said that in addition to the famine, one of the main causes of death is the shortage of food and water, which has led to a reduction in the number of elephants and other animals.
When eating, one elephant is said to need more than 200 pounds [500 kg] of food and to require more than two gallons [200 L] of water.
But now ZimParks estimates that there are more than 45,000 elephants in the area.
Some animal rights activists say the figures provided by ZimParks are false and say they are doing this as a way of getting support to be able to sell elephants.
Advocates4Earth member, Lenin Chisaira, admits that elephants and other animals are starving and malnourished, but he is one of the proponents of ZimParks' lack of transparency.
According to Chisaira, one of the main causes of hunger for animals in the Hwange National Park is the government's decision to allow people to do things such as mining, which they say should not be done in the area.
But Mr. Farawo said he was concerned about the views of animal rights activists who said they did not want to accept the fact that elephants and other animals are increasing due to the good work of his department, adding that the department is open and its doors open to all who want to know the situation in zoos.
Zimbabwe and other northern African countries, including Botswana, say they want the International Convention on the Trade in Endagered to allow them to sell their elephants as the number of animals has increased, which has led to a number of problems, including human and animal poaching.
Thirty-three people have been killed by the animals of the organization this year alone.
At a CITES summit in Geneva, Switzerland in August, the organization rejected a call for the lifting of the ban on the sale of elephants and their ivory.
The head of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe, Emmanuel Fundira, said it was important for CITES and animal rights activists to understand the problems facing Zimbabwe and other countries due to the high number of elephants in these countries.
The Minister of Climate and Tourism, Nqobizitha Ndlovu, told Studio 7 that the government is trying its best to work with other countries to give CITES a new perspective.
But they also said they could take a move called reservation which allows them to export elephants to other CITES countries that have taken the same step.
Hwange National Park opened in 1928 and is the largest national park in the country.
The organization is over 14,000 square miles [14,000 sq km] and at its inception was estimated to have only about 2,000 elephants.
The General Secretary of the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe, FUZ, Paul Gundani, died in Kwekwe on Wednesday afternoon after a short illness.
But it is still unknown how things turned out.
According to FUZ, Gundani died at Topomasi Private Hospital in Kwekwe.
The club also says their absence has left a large gap that will be difficult to close as they have a passion for helping football players.
Gundani, who previously played for Zisco Steel, also played for the Young Warriors, and played for the Warriors at a time when the team was known as the "Dream Team" under the tutelage of the late Reinard Fabisch.
FUZ media officer Marlene Gadzirayi said she was shocked to hear that Gundani had passed away.
"I am very sad as I spoke to them yesterday and we were already planning how to proceed. But I heard today that they are missing but at this stage I do not know what Mr Gundani ate," Ms Gadzirayi told Studio7.
Ms Gadzirayi says the country has lost a great football hero. Ms Gadzirayi also said there were no plans for Mr Gundani's funeral as he was waiting to hear from his family when he would be laid to rest.
The Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has announced on its website that it is saddened by Gundani's death and will stand by the family in all his funeral arrangements.
ZIFA communications officer Xolisani Gwesele said Gundani's death was a national tragedy and it would be difficult to find a man with a passion for football.
"Peace be upon you Paul Gundani," Gwesela wrote on the ZIFA website.
Former President Robert Mugabe's body could not be flown to his home in Zvimba today as his wife, Grace Mugabe, has fallen ill.
Some relatives say the body is due to arrive in Zvimba on Monday.
As many as 1,000 people have been waiting for President Mugabe's body for a day in Zvimba this afternoon.
A spokesman for the Mugabe family, who is also the grandson of the deceased, Leo Mugabe, said Mugabe's body could not be found today for reasons he said he did not know as he had just been sent by King Zvimba.
Leo Mugabe said the body would arrive home early in the morning.
But King Katizagombo, also known as Gibson Jenami, said the body would not return to Zvimba as expected since Ms Grace Mugabe was ill.
King Katizagombo also said the body will be in the hands of the government until the day it is laid to rest.
But this contradicts Leo Mugabe, who said Mugabe's body would be kept by his family until a high-level grave was completed.
Uncertainty at President Mugabe's funeral procession has left many in a state of shock as to whether or not Mugabe's body will arrive as it is almost 30 days before his burial.
Leo Mugabe said Mugabe's body would remain in Zvimba for a day and then return to Harare where he would be laid to rest.
Leo Mugabe said people had gathered in one place at President Mugabe's home in Harare.
A member of the opposition MDC-T led by Nelson Chamisa who was also expected to die in Zvimba today, Lloyd Tarubwa of Banket, who was abducted and detained for nine months without trial, said they had come to see if President Mugabe was really dead.
The conduct of Mr. Mugabe's funeral has shocked many in the country, claiming that Mr. Mugabe's troubles during his tenure were the cause of his death.
Mr Mugabe passed away in Singapore on September 6 after a long illness.
The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe, or ARTUZ, says one of its leaders, Godfrey Chanda, was abducted by detectives and detained for two hours in Gweru without the public's knowledge.
But Chanda, who is a member of the ARTUZ committee in the Midlands region, has been released after being forced not to hold meetings with coaches in Gweru.
ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure said Chanda's dismissal came as coaches under his two-day strike went on strike for a three-day strike.
Masaraure says some coaching associations are also striking as a way to support their union.
The demonstration ends on Wednesday.
But Masaraure said a meeting would be held after the strike to plan for action.
We have not been able to contact the Minister of Labor, Ms Sekai Nzenza, to find out the government's position on the matter but her mobile phone has not been answered.
FC Platinum's sudden exit from the Caf Champions League has raised many questions about Zimbabwean football.
Although they still have two games left in the competition, FC Platinum will no longer be able to hold Esperance who have eight points, nor will they be able to beat Horoya Athletic Club who have seven points. as they were beaten at home and outside by Horoya which is the first to be watched if these teams finish the games equally on points.
At the moment, FC Platinum have only one point from four games so they are just playing to complete their remaining games in order to gain the respect of another fan of the game Spencer Mushambadope.
Mushambadope says there will be no results for the remaining matches.
Last year, the same team was released in the first round by Angola's Primeiro de Agosto after being beaten at home by Lunda again.
In 2017, Caps United reached the mini league stage of the tournament but failed to reach the quarter-finals after being beaten 4-2 at home by Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya.
The same year, the Ngezi Platinum Stars who were representing Zimbabwe in the Caf Confederation were knocked out of the tournament in the first round when they were beaten by the Angolan Libolo.
In 2016 Harare City who were in the same competition were eliminated in the first round by Zanaco of Zambia after being beaten 2-1 at Rufaro Stadium and then finished 3-1 in Zambia.
This shows that local teams are failing to stand up to other African teams as was the case in previous years when Dynamos competed effectively in reaching the Caf Champions League final in 1998 and the semi-finals in 2008.
What hurts the most is that FC Platinum have only one point in four games, they have not scored a single point, moreover, they have conceded six points in four games.
The question is, if a team is beating all the teams at will in Zimbabwe and they are playing like this in Africa, what does it mean for national football?
Caps United supporter Tinashe Musebi says football has deteriorated to such an extent that there is a need for more reforms, before Zimbabwean teams fall short of surpassing Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland.
Football commentator Farai Kambamura says Zimbabwean teams are failing to play in Africa because the players who helped them win the league title in Zimbabwe are going abroad, especially to South Africa when they are competing in Africa.
Last year, FC Platinum lost Gerald Takwara, Elvis Chipezeze and Talent Chawapiwa, this year lost to Rodwell Chinyafanere who won the soccer star of the year trophy who went to Baroka.
But John Chikochi, who led the Lengthens team in the Premier Soccer League, said Zimbabwe needed to increase its football competitions in the country so that clubs could pay players a fee that would prevent them from fleeing to South Africa and Zambia.
Currently, Zimbabwe has only two clubs, the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League and the Chibuku Super Cup. The Zifa Cup was last played in 2005.
A football fan, Musa Masepe, says Zimbabwe has no football talent as players are opting to sing or something else as their salaries in football are no longer viable.
If this continues, it will take time for local teams to compete with other African teams.
Elections to represent the Democratic Party in the US presidential election in November are raging following the election of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Bloomberg, who has become a very rich man, did not run in the by-elections to represent his party in the presidential election, which will be contested by Republican Party spokesman Donald Trump.
Mr Bloomberg announced in November last year that he was joining the party, spending more than $ 400 million on advertising. This money is theirs.
The rich man did not run in the by-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire, nor will he run in the by-elections in Navada and South Carolina, pending the March election, when 14 states will elect a candidate to represent the Democratic Party in the US presidential election.
As soon as Bloomerg put his foot down in the running for office, former members of the party, such as Bernie Sanders, who represents Vermont in the Senate, and Elizabeth Warren, who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, began tearing down Bloomberg's record.
Speaking ahead of a Nevada political rally, Mr. Sanders said that in order for his party to defeat Mr. Trump, it needed someone who could mobilize more people than ever before in American history.
Mr Sanders said Mr Bloomberg was a well-known figure in New York mayor's decision to suspend and search for black people, as well as to Latinos, who were unfairly doing so. He said such a move could not get more people to vote for Mr. Trump's removal in November.
But Bloomerg slammed Mr. Sanders' comments, saying Mr. Sanders, who is leading the polls, has been elected a Democratic Party candidate in the presidential election, which will be with Mr. Trump for the next four years.
A political analyst and Zanu PF member, Frank Guni, said it was clear that the main match was between Sanders and Bloomberg, although it was clear that Sanders now had too many supporters.
Guni says, in his view, Sanders and Bloomberg should run in the presidential election together in order to defeat Trump.
Some candidates in the Democratic Party say; Barack Obama's former successor, Joe Biden; Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, as well as former mayor of South Bend in Indiana, and a gay man, Pete Buttigieg.
The Democratic Party has 3,979 delegates, and for a person to be nominated as a candidate for the presidential election, he or she must have 1,990 delegates (1,990).
In addition to the delegates, there are also super delegates so that when the Democratic Convention is held in July in Wisconsin, there should be 4,750 delegates and supervisors, and the person elected at this meeting, should get 2,200 votes. three seventy-six votes (2,376 votes).
Many people go to the banks early in the morning in the hope of making money as a guarantee of the world's largest bank but have ridden a rotten donkey.
A survey conducted by Studio 7 at various banks in Harare, Bulawayo, Chinhoyi, Masvingo, Mutare, Gweru and other cities revealed that no banks have received the new money and many banks have not been able to provide the people with the old one.
Jossam Marwira, one of the bankers, said he had been waiting for the money for a day as he had heard in the news that a new currency would be added.
Mr Marwira said he was particularly concerned about buying money on the streets and said it would be better for people like him to be able to get money from banks free of charge.
A man who buys and sells money on the street who declined to be named also told Studio 7 that he was also looking forward to the new currency but saw nothing.
RBZ, the central bank, recently announced that it would launch new investments in the hope of alleviating the country's financial woes.
RBZ Governor John Mangudya has announced that he will issue a $ 2 gold bond as well as a $ 2.5 bond bond that was expected to come into effect today.
Bankers Association of Zimbabwe president Webster Rusere also said they had not yet checked whether any of the banks had received the money, saying RBZ was the only source of information.
The issue of money laundering is causing controversy in the country, with some saying it will help people who are worried about money while others say it is a scapegoat.
Zimbabweans driving in South Africa have been living in a state of shock following the burning of cars by suspected South Africans who do not want foreign nationals to find work.
South African government ministers for police, Bheki Cele; Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula; and the Minister of Labor, Thulas Nxesi, held a meeting with truck drivers, job seekers and the owners warned to take action against those who are burning the trucks.
Cele warned truckers were on fire that they would be arrested as they were disrupting economic affairs.
But just two hours after they finished talking a truck burned down on the N2 in Durban.
A police spokesman, Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, acknowledged that another truck had been set on fire.
Over the weekend, 18 trucks, including those feared by other Zimbabweans, were also set ablaze in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.
The chairman of the Zimbabwe Exiles Forum, Gabriel Shumba, said the trucks had been set ablaze on highways in the SA, prompting the temporary closure of the roads.
Representing South Africa's Zimbabwe Exemption Permits, Edward Muchatuta, said that after the incident, he and other foreign drivers also protested, demanding that the SA government intervene.
One of the drivers, George Nanyika, has called for a dialogue.
Davie Munodawafa, another driver, said he also feared for his life.
Munadawafa went on to say that many drivers do not know their future.
South Africa's police chief, Bheki Cele, yesterday warned that the police would take strict action against those who set fire to the vehicles. This, in turn, is what caused the other side of the coin to stop.
Lions told Studio7 that the incident was a repeat of what South Africans had previously said that foreign nationals should leave SA.
Journalists have also been criticized by Shumba for failing to inform the public about the incident.
Lions went on to say that their organization has written letters to foreign embassies in South Africa, including Zimbabwe, asking them to work together to end the crisis.
Dewa Mavhinga, Human Rights Watch's regional director for North Africa, condemned the incident and urged motorists not to travel at night.
The country's economic woes are prompting Zimbabweans to seek employment in South Africa, which has sparked tensions as South Africans complain of being deprived of jobs by foreigners.

Zimbabwe on Friday joined the rest of the world in marking International Women's Day, with many women saying they continue to be oppressed and deprived because leaders in the country do not care to promote them to equal opportunities.
Although Zimbabwe has a constitution that binds equality of opportunity between women and men, many of the women we spoke to said there was no need or concern from government officials, political parties, churches or companies to ensure that this happened.
A former member of parliament and lawyer, Ms Jessy Majome, told Studio 7 that women are suffering the most in the country due to the negligence of men in leadership positions.
They say there is a great opportunity for the country to close the gap between women and men if the constitution is adhered to.
The head of the Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association, Abigail Matsvai, told Studio 7 that today is a very important day and they are using it to encourage leaders in government to adhere to laws that equalize opportunities between men and women.
A member of the Gender Commission, Ms. Tsungirai Hungwe-Chimbunde, told Studio 7 that strong education is needed to make the public aware of the importance of equal opportunities between women and men.
He said his commission was trying its best to reach out to various political parties to give their members equal opportunities in the elections so that more women could run for office.
This year's celebrations are being held under the theme, Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change.
Ms Majome said in line with the theme, the electoral commission should use these powers to provide equal seats for women and men in the 2023 elections.
Ms. Matsvai has supported these reform groups in the leadership positions.
Ms Majome also said it was important for women to unite and fight their battles together and not be exploited by men.
He said it was clear that many men in office did not want to leave the party, which was why they were fighting women and giving them less opportunities to run for office.
International Women's Day is celebrated annually on March 8 as a way to celebrate women's progress in economic, political and other fields as well as to promote equality of opportunity between women and men around the world.
Government-sponsored celebrations were held in Gokwe in the Midlands region and many organizations also held ceremonies in various locations. MDC leader Nelson Chamisa was marking the day in Chitungwiza.
Other media outlets today, including the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission, said it was difficult for women to move forward with the current economic situation as no one was giving them a chance.
The Zimbabwe Peace Project has also issued a statement marking the day to protest against human rights abuses, including violations of human rights abuses in January following a nationwide protest.
The Labor Court has ruled that children who are absent from work must return to work within 48 hours as their activities are illegal.
Labor Court judge Rodgers Manyangadze and Lawrence Murasi have given the doctors two days to return to work.
The court also ruled that a dispute between the children's doctor and the government should be referred to a mediator in order to resolve the matter within 14 days.
Former vice-president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors' Association, Doctor Masimba Ndoro, said despite the ruling, doctors were not qualified to go to work.
Asked by Studio7 if they were afraid of losing their jobs if they did not comply with the court's order, Dr. Ndoro said employers should take action to get workers back to work.
The lawyer for the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors' Association, Doug Coltart, said he did not agree with the outcome but would look into the reasons.
Coltart also said he had a chance to appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling if doctors wanted to take action.
Studio7 was unable to hear the side of the health minister, Dr. Obadiah Moyo, along with the Health Services Board,
The doctors went on strike on September 3, saying they had no work to do.
Remaining senior doctors at work also staged a sit-in on Thursday last week complaining about salaries and conditions in hospitals.
The US government says that Cyclone Idai devastated Manicaland province and that the tragedy will continue to affect its people.
Speaking to Studio 7 at the US embassy, ​​Jason Taylor, USAID's director of disaster relief, said that while they were working with other agencies to rehabilitate roads and rebuild damaged buildings, they were now focusing more on food security to save lives.
Taylor said the crisis in Manicaland was so serious that the Zimbabwean government could not do it on its own.
Taylor, who visited Manicaland province with a World Food Program helicopter, where he is investing, said he was shocked to see the mental anguish in the region.
He said the children he saw were unhappy. He said it was important that after the people of Manicaland benefited from such things as food and housing, they should also be helped to regain their composure.
Taylor also said that in Chimanimani and Chipinge they did not see or meet with residents who said they were not getting help because of the political party they support.
USAID has also said it has the expertise to train Zimbabweans to look into the sky to determine when, and where the storms are likely to occur, as well as what steps they can take to prevent the destruction of lives and property if requested by the government.
Since the outbreak of Cyclone Idai, the United States has provided Zimbabwe with $ 2.6 million.
Meanwhile, the government, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations today launched a $ 60 million emergency relief fund for Cyclone Idai.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people need help in Manicaland province, and of these, 129,000 are young children.
In the nine districts disrupted by Cyclone Idai, 113 schools were destroyed, leaving 90,000 students homeless.
The government says more than 300 people are unaccounted for, and another 399 people died in the crash.
This number is expected to rise.
Some patients say they are being treated abroad following a strike by children's nurses who say they fear they may die in hospitals without treatment.
A study conducted by Studio 7 has revealed that some patients are now traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Botswana and Zambia for treatment there following the strike by the children's nurse.
One of the patients we spoke to at Parirenyatwa, Ms Molline Chindove, said she had been coming to the hospital for days for treatment but nothing was moving.
Ms Chindove said she was going to South Africa for treatment for fear of dying of thirst with her legs in the water.
One of her relatives, Fiona Muchabaiwa, said she had no choice but to transport her patient to Zambia tomorrow for treatment, saying it was too expensive.
A study conducted by Studio 7 has revealed that many of the previously closed public hospitals are causing more and more people seeking treatment to leave public hospitals for treatment in private hospitals.
Wilbert Kasanze said he had taken his wife from Chegutu General Hospital to be treated at a private hospital in Chitungwiza.
Kasanze says the daily bus ride from Chegutu where he lives to Chitungwiza is causing his pocket money to run out.
The Health Services Board has announced that the retired child nurses will return to work immediately.
The board also called on all strikers to resign and urged them to re-apply if they still wanted a job.
This follows a statement issued by Deputy President Constantino Chiwenga calling for all striking nurses to resign.
But Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights says the dismissal of children by the government as a nurse without a dismissal certificate is illegal.
Football star Lionel Messi, who plays for Argentina and Spanish club Barcelona, ​​says he is breaking up his marriage with his country after failing to win a single trophy.
Messi made the remarks after the Copa America tournament hosted in the United States when Argentina lost in the final to Chile for the second time as Chile lifted the trophy.
Chile defeated Argentina on Sunday when Francisco Silva drunkenly sent Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Romero to the wrong side.
The two teams had drawn 0-0 in front of 82,000 supporters in East Rutherford in New Jersey.
Teams playing in the Copa America come from North and South America.
Three years ago, Argentina lost to Chile in the finals after the teams drew 0-0 again. Messi scored the first penalty and failed. Argentina lost 4-2 on penalties.
Messi then told Argentina's TyC Sports broadcaster that he had stopped playing for Argentina because he had failed to win the trophy despite his ambition.
Messi is 29 years old.
And he managed to win four Champions League trophies with Barcelona. But he has not won a Copa America or World Cup with Argentina.
Some patients in Bulawayo were failing treatment at two of the city's largest public hospitals when a doctor's strike entered its fourth day on Tuesday.
When Studio7 arrived at Mpilo Hospital during the day, some patients were being sent home as they were being treated for serious illnesses such as pregnant women with birth defects.
A resident who identified herself only as Ms Dlamini told Studio7 that she had come to the hospital with her swollen legs and was told to return home as they could not be seen by doctors.
We have tried to hear the situation from the hospital's director, Leonard Mabande, but he said we have spoken to the former chief medical officer, Dr Xolani Ndlovu, who said he could not speak to us as he had a lot of work to do.
At United Bulawayo Hospitals the hospital's outpatient unit or Outpatients Department has been closed and a notice issued by the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Narcisaus Dzvanga, also indicates that the hospital is only accepting patients who are critically ill.
Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association spokesman Dr Mthabisi Bhebhe said doctors were continuing to strike across the country despite government calls for them to return to work, saying they had not heard from the government.
Dr Ndlovu said the poor state of affairs in hospitals, including the lack of medicines and other facilities, was the main reason for the strike.
Studio 7 was unable to hear the government's side of the story as we were unable to contact the health minister, Dr Obadiah Moyo.
But Dr Moyo's deputy, Dr John Mangwiro, told Studio 7 on the phone that they could not comment on the matter as they were out of the country and the department's secretary, Dr Gerald Gwinji, did not return calls.
Bulawayo Metropolitan Province MP for proportional representation, Dorcas Sibanda, told Studio 7 that the doctors' strike had been going on for some time, adding that it was unfortunate that the lives of many people were being jeopardized by the government.
Government doctors went on strike on Saturday and in large public hospitals are working doctors who have been working for many years as consultants, or consultant physicians.
Former Highlanders player and coach Barry Daka, 71, has died after a short illness.
Their daughter, Lorraine has told Studio 7 that her father passed away today at their home in Barbourfields.
He said they became ill on Sunday when they were leaving a concert at Barbourfields Stadium and he is thought to have suffered a stroke.
The Highlangers team posted a message on Twitter saying they were "deeply saddened" by the death and said they were mourning the loss of their family and others in sports news.
The club says Mr Daka started coaching the team in 1986 and managed to lift several trophies including the Independence Cup, Chibuku Trophy, Rothmans Shield and NetBrew Cup.
Arrangements for Mr Daka's funeral have not yet been announced.
Prominent musician Thomas Mapfumo says he will join other Zimbabwean children who will protest next month in New York at the start of the United Nations General Assembly, which is expected to be attended by President Robert Mugabe.
Mr Mapfumo said it was important for Zimbabweans to show their displeasure with the way things were going in the country as it was everyone's right to do so if things did not go well.
Mr Mapfumo said he would not be playing the guitar during the protest as he wanted to join Zimbabweans in showing the world government, especially President Mugabe, that things needed to change in the country.
"I am a musician but at the New York I will not be singing I will be joining others to protest against the corruption and oppression of Zimbabweans by the Mugabe government which is no longer popular," Mapfumo told Studio 7.
Organizations such as #ThisFlag led by Pastor Evan Mawarire, Tajamuka, Occupy Africa Unity Square and other NGOs and political parties affiliated with Zimbabweans from different cities are expected to join the protest.
Others expected to be at the rally include Patson Dzamara, the younger brother of human rights activist Itai Dzamara, who went missing last year.
The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) says there are no talks between the government and teachers on resolving teachers' grievances.
ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure told Studio7 that his organization was unhappy to see students lacking funding for education, while teachers lacked funds to go to work.
Masaraure said many members of his party were writing letters of resignation saying they were looking for other jobs as their salaries were not enough to support their families.
We have not been able to contact the Minister of Education, Professor Paul Mavhima, to hear his side of the story.
As the world marks October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Cancer Association of Zimbabwe says it is deeply concerned about the misunderstanding of some people in the country.
The organization reports that many people who claim to have been diagnosed with cancer, first go to a psychiatrist or a psychiatrist, and then to a specialist for serious illness, making it difficult to treat.
Cancer Association of Zimbabwe consultant Priscilla Mangwiro said it was important for people to go to a qualified doctor if they had the problem.
Ms Mangwiro says it is important for people to be screened for cancer, especially breast cancer.
Ms. Mangwiro says breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women in Zimbabwe.
Ms. Mangwiro says that since October 1, when it launched its campaign to mark October as Cancer Awareness Month, its organization has tested more than 50 women, and the number will continue to rise until the end of this month.
After hearing about the Cancer Association of Zimbabwe program, a woman, Gertrude Magwaniza, said she took her daughter for a lump in her breast.
Ms Mangwiro says there are many factors that put women at risk of developing breast cancer.
Ms Mangwiro says women need to be monitored for changes in their breasts, and if they do, they should be screened immediately.
Ms Mangwiro says many people think that being diagnosed with cancer means they are dying but there is a lot that can be done to help women live longer.
Ms. Mangwiro says one of the main causes of cancer is eating a diet high in fat and sugar.
Ms. Mangwiro is urging women to take advantage of the October opportunity to get tested for cancer, as well as to be educated about the disease.
More than 5,000 people are infected every year and more and more will see a pediatrician for a serious illness.
The state-owned petrol company Petrotrade says if the government continues to set prices for the purchase and sale of motor fuel, the problem of fuel shortages will not go away.
Responding to a parliamentary proposal on fuel prices, former Petrotrade chief executive Godfrey Ncube said this was only possible if businesses were given the opportunity to buy fuel and sell at their own expense.
Mr Ncube acknowledged that doing so would raise prices but said it was the only way out of the country's long-running oil crisis.
Mr Ncube said waiting for the government's oil supply was slowing down oil prices in the country as they were getting more fuel in the long run.
Mr Ncube pointed out the shortage of fuel purchased by government assistance with the example he gave, saying that in the first six months last year, they sold 50 million liters, but in the same period this year they sold only 36 million liters.
Asked when her department hopes to address the fuel shortage crisis, fire department secretary Gloria Magombo said the problem would not go away if foreign investment was low.
He also said that addressing the issue needs the whole country and not just his department.
Asked whether the plan to use the Smart Card to buy fuel was mentioned by the governor of the central bank, John Mangudya, when he said the card would show the amount of fuel consumed by each car in the garage used to buy the fuel, Ms Magombo said the plan was reversed by the COVID-19 scandal. there was a need to buy in China.
Ms Magombo said she could not say when the plan would be successful, although Mr Mangudya told the committee last month that he hoped by the end of June they would try to use the card to see if it worked as intended.
This has angered a parliamentary committee that has said the fire department is failing to do its job as Ms Magombo also said she had heard from members of the committee today that many petrol stations in the country were selling for US dollars or foreign currency coupons.
The committee said it was "deeply concerned" that many developments in the country are being affected by the shortage of fuel.
Zimbabweans on Saturday mark the 40th anniversary of the country's independence from white supremacy, with blacks and other blacks being enslaved.
The advent of black supremacy raised the hopes of many that they would eventually gain a white supremacy, many of whom had been thrown into the abyss by whites as they took all their good land.
But 40 years after the country gained independence, some of them have said things have gotten worse for them compared to the white supremacy, as they no longer have jobs to support their families.
They say that the economic situation is so bad that it is difficult to know what the future holds.
Health issues are said to be at an all-time low as many hospitals in the country are no longer functioning as expected.
A few who are still working say that they often spend it on the streets protesting in order to earn a living.
The inauguration of former president Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2017, following the military ousting of former president Robert Mugabe, has given the public hope for a brighter future.
But most of them have been celebrating the witch and witch doctor, as they say things are getting worse.
But isn't there any good thing that Zanu PF has done for all these 40 years?
Zanu PF North American regional chairman Regis Charumbira says his party has done much to give land to blacks, regardless of party affiliation.
Mr Charumbira said his party had now completed an investigation into who had acquired more farms than others, and that those who had not yet acquired land, including Zimbabweans living abroad, should be acquired.
But Timothy Muringai, deputy secretary general of the MDC-T in North America, said Zanu PF had failed for many years to fulfill all the demands of the liberation struggle.
They say things have deteriorated for years in economic, health and business closures, leaving many workers on the streets unemployed.
Attorney Ntabazinduna Nhlanhlayamangwe Ndiweni or Lord Felix Ndiweni has appealed to the High Court today to challenge his sentence and sentence him to 18 months imprisonment.
Ishe Ndiweni and 23 others were arrested for breaking the fence of Fetti Mbele who wanted to evict him from Ntabazinduna district.
This follows the alleged rape of Mbele's wife, Nonkangelo Mpengesi.
Lord Ndiweni's lawyer, Dumisani Dube, told Studio 7 that the judge did not value the authority of chiefs in his constituency.
Popular musician Thomas Mukanya Mapfumo says he is looking forward to releasing his new album this month after the company's computer computer crashed.
The company is based in Eugene, Oregon in the United States and is called Tracktown Studios. Doctor Mapfumo told Studio 7 that out of the 15 songs he had recorded, only three remained.
The High Court has ruled that Heal Zimbabwe's president, Rashid Mahiya, has set aside bail to be tried from his home.
Mahiya, who has been in Chikurubi prison, is expected to be released on Friday after police said they could not complete their paperwork on time.
Mahiya's lawyer, who works with Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Tonderayi Bhatasara, told Studio 7 that in addition to the $ 1,000 bail bond, the court confiscated Mahiya's travel document and the need for his house and to report to the police twice a week.
"We have accepted the court's ruling because the important thing is for the person to be released and released from detention," Bhatasara told VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe, adding: "
Mahiya is one of a number of people arrested in recent weeks on charges of plotting to overthrow the government after protests erupted over petrol prices.
Speaking to reporters in Harare, the secretary general of the Zimbabwe Medical Association, Sacrifice Chirisa, said he had received a letter from senior doctors or consultant doctors urging them to resign if the government did not address the grievances of young striking doctors.
Chirisa, who also happens to be the chief medical officer, said the workload has increased for senior doctors as junior doctors have been on strike for a month.
Chirisa said that in order to do their job properly, they need young doctors to work alongside them.
Mr Chirisa said the problem of patients in government hospitals was exacerbated by the absence of young doctors and 533 doctors who had been suspended following a move by the Health Services Board.
The general secretary of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Mthabisi Anele Bhebhe, also said he was unhappy with the comments made yesterday by former president Constantino Chiwenga that young doctors were still in school.
Chiwenga, who was appointed by the cabinet to lead the dialogue between the government and the striking doctors, fired the nurses after the strike.
Their actions have been criticized by many who say Mr Chiwenga was using the military on issues that require dialogue.
Young doctors say they want the government to provide them with medical equipment, medicine and protective clothing while on duty as well as an increase in salaries which they say is similar to dog taxes.
But the government also says its coffers are so depleted that it cannot afford to increase them.
We were unable to hear the side of the health minister, Mr Obadiah Moyo, as he immediately attended a meeting with the pediatrician at the time we first went on air.
The Labor Court has rejected the government's request as the government has not submitted any documents in its case against doctors who are not going to work.
Doug Coltart, a lawyer representing the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctor's Association in Labor Court, said the court said there was not enough documentation from the Health Services Board, HSB, and therefore the matter could not be heard legally.
The court ordered the HSB's lawyer to file the missing documents tomorrow, Wednesday.
But doctors have also said that going to court is not the key to getting them to go to work, so it does not solve the problem.
Former vice-president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Doctor Masimba Ndoro, said his job required him to be on a daily basis and he needed to be paid for this.
The junior doctors went on strike on September 3, saying they did not have enough resources to go to work.
Senior doctors from the Zimbabwe Senior Hospital Doctors' Association also went on strike last Thursday, complaining about poor pay and inadequate medical care.
The senior doctors also wrote a letter complaining about the threats they were making and said it was useless for doctors to go to hospitals without adequate facilities to save patients' lives.
The doctors also criticized the government, saying the money had been increased by 60 percent, saying they did not agree with it.
Meanwhile, two other senior doctors have been suspended without pay by the University of Zimbabwe on charges of joining the strike and influencing others to resign.
Suspended is Dr. Bothwell Mbuvayesango, who specializes in pediatric surgery, with Drs. David Chimuka, an expert in the treatment of heart disease.
Dr. Mbuvayesangano made a name for himself in the country after his successful surgery on twins who were born with their heads together in 2014, while Dr. Wake up to a great deal of heart surgery.
The Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights has strongly condemned the suspension of Dr. Mbuvayesangano with Dr. Get up.
We have not been able to hear from the University of Zimbabwe or to hear from the government on the state of health issues.
But a statement from Health Minister Obadiah Moyo acknowledged that doctors had not heeded the government's call to return to work.
Moyo said the government was awaiting the outcome of the court proceedings, after which he informed the state of the situation.
Doctors went on strike on September 3, saying they did not have enough money to go to work.
The government has signed an agreement with a foreign company to assist in the export of coal to countries such as India and Japan.
Speaking at the signing of the agreement with Victoria Consulting, the Minister of Minerals, Winston Chitando, said the government's intention was for the country to have access to coal trading in India and to raise funds for mining.
Chitando said Zimbabwe has an estimated 25 billion tonnes of coal but between 2 and 3 million tonnes are mined annually.
Chitando also said India is the largest importer of coal per year compared to other countries.
Speaking at the same meeting, the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said Zimbabwe should take advantage of the good relations that exist between it and India.
Studio7 has not been able to determine which Victoria Consulting company has worked with, and who its executives are.
But former deputy minister of mineral wealth in the coalition government, Gift Chimanikire, said he did not see the need for Zimbabwe to find markets for coal exports, which currently do not have enough coal mined in the country.
An economist, Nyasha Muchichwa, also said he did not see the need for Zimbabwe to find a foreign company that was interested in Zimbabwe's coal markets.
Mr Muchichwa also said it was better to use existing relations with other countries.
The Ministry of Minerals website says Zimbabwe has the best coal, and has 29 coal-mining areas.
Only two companies in the country, Hwange Colliery and Mountain Resources, are the largest coal miners.
Six members of the MDC-T party led by Nelson Chamisa, who were arrested in Harare on Friday, have been released on $ 1,000 bail each from their homes.
Given bail by Magistrate Chancellor Bianca Makwande, two of Chamisa's deputies; Tendai Biti and Ms. Lynett Karenyi Kore; foreign affairs secretary, Ms. Gladys Hlatywayo; Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr Lovemore Chinoputsa; a member of the National Standing Committee, and is the party's deputy secretary general, David Chimhini and Ms Vongai Tome.
The men have been ordered to pay $ 1,000 per person following their arrest yesterday following a dispute over the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai House.
Ms Makwande said the detainees would return to court on July 24 and remain at the address they had registered with the police until their case was heard.
Speaking to Studio 7 after the verdict, one of the six lawyers, Alec Muchadehama, said the court also ordered the people they were representing not to obstruct the investigation into the case.
Mr Muchadehama also said that although the six were yesterday charged with rioting under the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, the detainees, who had appeared in court this morning, were returned to the police station where they were charged with violating the COVID-19 Prevention Act.
The six lawyers have also complained to the court about the alleged treatment of the detainees.
Mr Muchadehama said the detainees were not well protected and could not catch or transmit COVID-19 while in custody.
The party's president, Nelson Chamisa, has said he will continue to fight for change in the country despite the arrests of its members
Ms Makwande has denied that the party's deputy youth spokesperson, Womberaishe Nhende, who is being treated at a hospital, should remain in custody.
Mr Nhende was reportedly injured yesterday when he was arrested and taken to hospital.
In a separate lawsuit, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights alleges that a police officer arrested after comparing President Emmerson Mnangagwa to a used condom was suspended and released on $ 300 bail.
The officer, Shungudzemoyo Kache, will also be tried at his home.
The head of Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries, Walter Magaya, has been adamant about his detention in Zimbabwe, saying he is working with other countries to launch an Aguma drug that he says cures HIV / AIDS, cancer and more.
Speaking to Studio7 at the end of a prayer service in Francistown, Botswana on Wednesday night, Mr. Magaya said he would not back down from his plan to arrest him by police in November 2018 after announcing that he had found a cure for HIV / AIDS.
After pleading guilty to trafficking in HIV / AIDS, Mr. Magaya was fined $ 700 in February last year.
But the incident did not deter Mr Magaya, who told Studio7 that they were working with other countries they did not want to name and said they saw Aguma's cure as a solution to the HIV / AIDS problem.
Mr Magaya said HIV / AIDS was a problem in Africa and therefore required all countries to work together to find a solution to the problem.
Mr Magaya said he saw fit to work with other countries because Zimbabwe was not confident that the drug would cure the country's deadly diseases.
However, in the case against Magaya in Zimbabwe, Aretha Medical Company's company was found to be unregistered with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe, and was reportedly not authorized by the Health Professions Authority to conduct an investigation into whether Aguma's drug was effective.
A doctor at a private hospital in Francistown, Sengaphi Khuzwayo, criticized Magaya for saying he was looking for money.
Mr. Magaya had previously caused controversy in the country after he was arrested for raping another woman, but the case was later dropped by a court after the plaintiffs dismissed the case legally.
The lack of pediatricians in government hospitals has put the lives of pregnant women at risk if they have a problem like the one at Chinhoyi General Hospital.
Ms. Lisa Sibanda is a woman who has suffered from postpartum depression.
Ms Sibanda said her baby, who was still premature, died in the womb when she was delivered on Tuesday, but no doctor was able to help her, saying she had to be helped by a nurse who caused the baby to die.
Ms. Sibanda says the biggest problem has been having their cervix washed so late that it can be detrimental to their health.
Ms. Sibanda says they are also facing water shortages and the toilets at the hospital will not be accessible and they are already collecting rainwater.
Erasmus Zindoga, who brought his wife from Kariba, said he had not received any medical help from a doctor and that a doctor he had seen at the hospital had refused to treat his wife.
Zindoga said he had already rented a car from Kariba to Chinhoyi for the 250km drive as things were not going well at the Kariba hospital.
We have not heard how many women are facing such problems at the Chinhoyi hospital which receives patients from areas including Kariba, Hurungwe, Karoi, Makonde and Zvimba.
Former Mashonaland West health director Tapiwa Dhliwayo says doctors should be on duty throughout the province.
However, she acknowledged that nurses are not the only ones who should treat women who have had a miscarriage, as is the case at Chinhoyi Hospital.
Chinhoyi City Council spokesman Tichaona Mlauzi issued a statement last week stating that Chinhoyi, with a population of 120,000, is facing water shortages due to the three dead pumps being repaired.
The Cancer Association of Zimbabwe urges the public to be screened for breast cancer early and before the disease is serious.
More than 5,000 people are diagnosed with various forms of cancer each year in Zimbabwe, but many of them see a pediatrician for this serious disease.
The organisation's president, Junior Mavhu, says they currently have plans to screen women and men for breast cancer so that they can get help on time.
Cancer is said to be killing more people in the country, especially women, even though it is more common in men.
Another Cancer Center is urging women and men to take advantage of the opportunity in October to be screened for cancer, as well as to be educated about the disease openly as they celebrate World Breast Cancer Month.
The world is looking forward to this month as a time to remind people to be aware of breast cancer and how they can benefit from it.
Ms Mavhu's recommendation is that everyone should be monitored regularly so that the disease can be treated and treated before it spreads. body.
Zimbabwe marked two years on Saturday since the shooting deaths of six people in Harare after scores of people took to the streets to express their displeasure with the conduct of the 2018 elections.
The killings took place around the world as journalists from various countries, who were in Zimbabwe watching the first round of elections for Zanu PF leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, were vying for the presidency following the violent ousting of the party's former president, the late Robert Mugabe.
Mnangagwa was running against Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance, including leaders of minority opposition parties.
Following the shooting, the government was forced to form a commission to investigate the allegations. The commission had former South African president Kgalema Motlanthe as its chairman.
The commission released a statement indicating that the military and police had killed the six, and said the killers should be brought to justice. It also demanded that the government pay the relatives of the victims.
Mr Motlanthe's commission also said the government should send the children of the deceased to school, and that the police and the army should not place the law in their hands when people protest.
Human rights experts say the government has not yet complied with the Motlanthe Commission.
But Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said the government was aware of the Motlanthe Commission and had plans to ensure that the commission's commitments were met.
One of the commissioners who drafted the report, Lovemore Madhuku, who is also the chairperson of the National Constitutional Assembly, said his commission had completed its work and it was up to the Mnangagwa government to ensure it complied with the draft.
Madhuku also said his commission had issued an order for the government to compensate the relatives of the victims because the men had been shot by soldiers and police.
Human rights expert and Human Rights Watch's regional director for North Africa, Dewa Mavhinga, says the government is not showing any interest in implementing the Motlanthe Commission Report.
Mavhinga said it had been two years since the report was released, but no soldier had been arrested as recommended by Motlanthe's commission.
Many areas have been vacated after the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, his ministers, members of parliament and the business community, joined forces with the public to clean up their workplaces and live under the National Clean-Up Campaign launched three months ago.
Mnangagwa arrived at Parirenyatwa Hospital early in the morning with his ministers who helped clean up the hospital's unsanitary conditions.
Speaking after the clean-up at the hospital, Mr Mnangagwa said the program was well received and a good one as it would improve people's health.
He said he launched the day as a way to remind people that this is what they should do every day.
Mr Mnangagwa also said people should get rid of the garbage dump and learn from countries such as Rwanda where people are no longer allowed to spray houses and grass or walk barefoot.
Sports Minister, Kirsty Coventry, and her staff, who started sweeping in Simon Muzenda Street and ended up in Africa Unity Square where they swept with the staff of Meikles Hotel and TM Supermarket.
They said the public was shocked to see them on the street sweeping and people should always clean up their neighborhoods.
Employees of Zimbabwe Newspapers have also taken to the streets around the company's headquarters and the company has also bought bins and placed them on the streets to dump rubbish.
Zimpapers spokeswoman Beatrice Tonhodzayi told Studio 7 that pollution is so prevalent in the area where they work that they have seen fit to work with the government to clean up the city and the country.
He said the company's employees at its offices in all regions of the country had also joined the National Clean-Up Campaign today.
The mayor of Harare, Hebert Gomba, city councilors, and council staff have also swept and collected rubbish in various villages in Harare.
Speaking to Studio 7 after cleaning up trash with OK Machipisa workers at the Machipisa business premises in Highfields, Gomba said he was happy with the turnout today saying the city was clean.
He said although the city's clean-up operation required a campaign, the council was making every effort to keep the city clean.
Mr Mnangagwa inaugurated the day, which is celebrated on the first Friday of each month as a way for people to keep their neighborhoods clean and healthy.
The Ministry of Finance has said it will increase funding as well as bring more high-value money into the country as a way to address the country's financial crisis.
Speaking at a press conference in Harare today, the department's secretary, George Guvamatanga, said it was impossible for them to start by bringing in a significant amount of money which would have cost them two dollars and a dollar.
Guvamatanga also said his department was aware that the country's budget was low and that the government would address the problem.
Asked what steps they would take to address the problem of money laundering, Deputy Finance Minister Clemence Chiduwa said consumers would be asked how they got the money.
An economist with the Labor and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe, Nyasha Muchichwa, said the government could overcome the monetary policy issue only if it invested enough in the country, including foreign exchange.
Mr Muchichwa also said the issue of arresting money changers would not solve the problem as they would do so for a few days and then resume their activities.
The finance ministry has also acknowledged that funding for the health sector is insufficient compared to the current health crisis but has said it will continue to improve.
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube also told reporters at the press conference that he was pleased with the steps he had taken to improve the country's economy and progress.
But former finance minister Tendai Biti, one of the three MDC-T leaders, says the country's financial crisis is worsening as the country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, is doing more than it should be doing, which is costing the country a lot of money. .
Mr Biti, who also chairs the parliamentary finance committee, said the finance ministry, as well as the central bank, should act in accordance with the rules, and in such a way that the country's financial system does not disappear, as did loans from some senior government officials.
But the finance ministry says the public should be aware that there have been too many years of unspent national money in building the country, so resolving the crisis will take time.

Although it is clear that the public is transmitting the disease in the country, in bus markets and at banks crowded, or crowded, this makes the transmission of Covid-19 easier.
Studio7 has seen many people who were not wearing masks while meeting with members of the public in the city of Harare.
A Harare resident, Paul Majaira, who was unprotected, said he sometimes forgot to protect himself.
An unnamed man was waiting to withdraw money from a bank in the city when rivals confessed to Studio7 that he was aware that the number of COVID-19 cases in the country was rising.

The community is not happy about this, "said Mdakane.
Local councilor Nkosingiphile Mpembe said: "In 2010, temporary classrooms were set up, people were given the hope that the school would continue to be built, which has never been done before.

Couples beaten to death for allegedly stealing
POLICE are searching for suspects who killed a couple by beating them in Shayamoya in Mpumuza, outside Pietermaritzburg, on suspicion of theft.
Londeka Mvelase and Mxolisi Mchunu were allegedly beaten by members of the public, who died on Sunday.
The couple lived together.
They were accused of stealing about R2 500 and a neighbour's cellphone.
The respondent found that even after apologizing, they were not stopped beating and stoned.
Women and men were reportedly present when they were beaten.
A local councilor, Jabu Zondo, visited the area yesterday to reprimand the incident.
Speaking to Solezwe, he said although they were accused of theft, they should not have been killed.
"I'm back in the community.
There are cries of crime, it really bothers us in this area, however it is not allowed for the community to take revenge.
You must call the police and they will arrest the perpetrators.
Based on the information I received, the suspects were accused of shoplifting.
Stability is in place right now, there is peace.
The boy is not local, the woman is local.
I will still be looking for his family, and we will meet with them tomorrow (today) to discuss the matter, "said Ngubo.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said two murder cases had been opened and police were still searching for the suspects.

The Guptas were smuggling money to various banks
AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (ANA) It is estimated that R49 billion was misappropriated by the state, according to Shadow World director Paul Edward Holden, according to an investigation.
The director said this at a commission headed by Judge Raymond Zondo yesterday.
According to him, they found that the amount was R49 157 323 233.
68 was regularly deposited in different banks.
Holden said this testifying to the money that was deposited and withdrawn from various banks.
Leading witness, Advocate Matthew Chaskalson, was questioned by Holden.
Holden told the commission that his testimony was based on reports and how money was being paid to Gupta's businesses.
He alleged that the Guptas smuggled R287 million from the Estina Dairy Farm Project.
The plan was to develop farmers in the Free State.
Holden said the Guptas began smuggling money a year before the Estina program began.
The Free State government began funding the Estina program in June 2011 but the Guptas began smuggling money into the program in May 2011.
"They used the Estina system to hide and smuggle money, before the program started," Holden said.
According to the report, the government paid R287 million to the Gupta family, and the money was deposited in various company accounts to make it look like it was making a profit of R880million between 2012 and 2016.
The commission continues.
A video that shows everything about the death of the Bridegroom
A RELEVANT video has surfaced of the day Lindani Myeni was killed in Hawaii, USA
In the video, the bridegroom appears as he enters a house in Honolulu, wearing a crown and walks in behind two of the so-called couple.
He appears to have gone to the temple near their home.
He takes off his shoes from the temple and apologizes to the two men.
It is said that after about 40 seconds, the Bridegroom was seen leaving the house and apologizing to the couple.
Just then a woman appeared and called 911, reporting a burglary.
The woman told police she said her husband was in their house breaking into the house.
According to the homeowners, nothing was taken from their home.
Proponents of her case have been working to make the actual transcript of this statement available online.
Attorney Jim Bickerton, however, said the court had forced officials to release the video without filtering it.
Police were also asked to provide records of 911 calls on the day of the incident.
In an interview Bickerton had with Mr. William Denselow on eNCA he revealed that when the Bridegroom left the house he was not upset.
"His last words were to apologize until he disappeared," Bickerton said.
In the first video released police appear to the Bridegroom who asked them who they were, who shot him dead as he died in hospital.
He said they did not know Myeni was apologetic and police had the video but called a press conference saying they were attacked unnecessarily.
Bickerton said they would continue to search for the truth so that it could be known what was happening.
It is alleged that a split in the IFP erupted in Melmoth
They accused IFP councilors of harassing security guards who allegedly shot and wounded three members of the public at a party meeting in Thubalethu, Mthonjaneni (Melmoth), on Sunday afternoon.
It is said that the guards blasted by the Mayor dispersing the crowd of public members who said the bha · monarch closed the entrance to the convention hall.
One section of the community blamed the party's leadership for trying to bring them to their knees as they demanded the return of an IFP-fired local councilor.
The meeting was called by the IFP leadership in the King Cetshwayo region to clarify the issue that has divided the community, as last week he protested against the reinstatement of all expelled councilors, including former mayor Bonginkosi Biyela.
A member of the public who was part of the protest at the time of the shooting, who did not want to be named, accused IFP leaders and councilors present by telling security guards to shoot them so that they could not vent their anger.
"We were protesting on the street because we were not allowed to enter the hall because it was full of people from other areas.
The problem started when we detained another member of the public who was trying to force his way through a closed road, and security guards and councilors who were present got the chance to shoot, "said the member.
The IFP leader in Mthonjaneni, who did not want to be named, said members of the public in the area were divided.
"Last week, there was a protest demanding clarification on the dismissal of their councilor from the ward.
A meeting has been arranged for all councilors and IFP regional leaders to provide feedback to the public.
"The problem started when some members of the public stood in line outside the hall, and when the meeting started, they blocked the entrance to the hall, pelted stones at security guards and forced them to shoot because the community was attacking them.
Some members of the public were armed with firearms, "he said.
The meeting was attended by newly elected mayor Mbangiseni Biyela, his deputy Phumlani Ntombela and all councilors in the Mthonjaneni Municipality.
Attempts to get comment from the regional leadership were unsuccessful as their space calls could be intercepted and messages could not be answered.
A spokesman for the municipality, Thami Shangase, said the meeting was not planned by the municipality, adding that the matter was in the hands of the police.
Contacted, IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the party would issue a statement on the matter today.
Violence began with the dismissal of Biyela (former mayor) and four councilors, creating divisions among members of the public, especially IFP members in charge of the municipality.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said charges of attempted murder and civil unrest had been opened at the Melmoth police station.
Mbete denies ignoring corruption
FORMER Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbethe has dismissed allegations of corruption, saying some of it was a matter of debate.
Ms Mbete, responding to questions from a commission of inquiry into state control by a minority, alleging that some members of Parliament were involved in corruption, said in some cases the allegations were uncontrollable, while others seemed to be rumored because knowledgeable people had no evidence.
He even cited the issue of weapons involving former president Jacob Zuma as an example of the fact that he received a letter written on difficult material but did not know from whom it came.
"Chairperson, I know there have been people who have testified here, and the way the ANC is run.
I also know that the speaker has come here and said that you can't just talk about what you hear being said.
"I can speak of the arms case, the case that was postponed yesterday (Monday).
There is a letter placed under the door of my office.
The letter contained shocking and shocking details but was never signed and no one had written it.
Parliament is so busy, I could not take this book without knowing who wrote it and we talked about it.
The problem is who wrote it, that person had to come to me and understand me.
I am trying to answer now that in Parliament we would not be able to discuss the rumors, "Mbete said.
In June 2017, he was asked what he was doing in a case involving the Gupta family.
"I don't remember very well but I know it's about the leak of news affecting the Guptas.
I think by the time those stories came out, we would have called those who wrote them.
Let's see what they have to say about the world around you.
So that we can get an explanation and be able to do our job, "said Ms Mbethe.
They blamed NSFAS for the death of a student
STUDENTS are blaming NSFAS for the death of a student who allegedly died after sleeping for two days outside the entrance of the institution, Durban Tvet College, in Cato Manor, on Saturday.
It is alleged that the deceased, Yonwabo Manyanya (26), a graduate of Electrical Infrastructure Construction, was evicted by his tenants due to rent arrears.
The deceased was forced to sleep two days outside the center because he had nowhere else to hide following his eviction from his residence on Monday.
It was reported on Wednesday that the deceased was not in good health.
His fellow students reportedly told him he had to find a place to hide.
Yonwabo, who is said to have been living in the area, reportedly died on Saturday in the flat where his friend lived in Durban North.
One of the students, who was close to the deceased, who asked not to be named, said they were shocked by what had happened, and criticized NSFAS for dragging their feet in getting funding.
"I am not in a good mood after the avoidable incident.
I want NSFAS to intervene because it looks like there will be more incidents like this as winter sets in, "said the student.
A family member of the deceased, who could not be reached for comment, said they could not speak to the media about the incident.
KwaZulu-Natal police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said no case had been reported.
The financial crisis has also spread to the college's Asherville Campus campus, Sydenham, as more than 50 students protested outside the gates yesterday.
The students told Isolezwe they slept on the street outside the center because they had been evicted from their unpaid accommodation.
Most of the students, who were wearing pajamas, came from as far away as Gauteng, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga.
Mr Siyabonga Sambu, from Ermelo, Mpumalanga, a third-year Community Safety degree student, criticized the institution and NSFAS for fussing over them when they inquired about their funding applications.
He said since February they had not received any funding, the tenants had been guiding students in employment.
"There is no money for food.
Applicants were provided with transportation costs and a small amount received.
The center is useless and calls for the guards to evict us, "said Sambu.
This was confirmed by Zodwa Mabanga from Johannesburg who said he was living on the street because he had been evicted.
Dr Mthabisi Bhebhe, general secretary of the Mpilo Hospital Doctors Association, said he was unhappy with the outcome and wanted Dr Magombeyi to be found alive. Dr Bhebhe, a former secretary of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, also said he wanted his grievances resolved.
Another doctor, Dr Tawanda Manjonjo, who claims to have worked with Dr Magombeyi, said many doctors were now fearing for his life, but added that unless Doctor Magombeyi was found, he would return to work only if his grievances were resolved.
The director of Mpilo Hospital, Leonard Mabandi, said that as far as he knew, doctors had promised to return to work after a short strike.
A man who identified himself as Walter, who claims to have had his wife treated, says that many patients have not been seen by doctors.
Doctors are on strike after Doctor Magombeyi was abducted. Doctors have been out of work for two weeks saying they will no longer be able to afford transportation.
The government says it is drafting a law banning doctors from striking, but human rights experts say this is unconstitutional.
Thousands of people lined the streets of Kentucky here in the United States bid farewell to boxing champion Muhammad Ali who died on Friday last week at the age of 74.
Other celebrities in attendance include former US President Bill Clinton, boxing champions George Foreman, Mike Tyson and Lenox Lewis and Will Smith, a well-known film star.
President Obama sent a message of condolence. A Zimbabwean national living in Louisville, Kentucky, Patricia Chikanga, says the country can learn a lot from honoring deceased athletes.
"I have learned that those who represent the country and die like Muhammad Ali should be honored as we have seen with this boxer. The whole city is full of tourists and locals who have come to mourn Ali. The other day we saw his box coming from the airport. It touched my heart to see that I hope this will be done at home for our athletes when they die, ”Ms Chikanga told Studio 7.
The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) says it is deeply saddened by the experience of Matabeleland South, Matabeleland North and Bulawayo districts as they handed out protective clothing to nurses working in church hospitals in the region.
ZCC has mobilized protective clothing to donate to nurses, doctors and other staff in church hospitals in the three districts.
ZCC secretary general, Pastor Doctor Kenneth Mtata told Studio 7 that they found many people hungry and worried which upset members of their group.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture, and that his confession had been obtained through torture.
He said the government should put politics aside and immediately intervene in helping people who are starving.
Dr Mtata said his organization would inform the government of all its findings so that it could assist as soon as possible as many households are suffering from hunger and anxiety.
The Zimbabwean dollar continues to weaken and inflation continues to skyrocket as in 2007 and 2008.
The American dollar is being traded for $ 32 to $ 40.
Food, fuel, and other commodities have become so expensive that some have called for the use of the national currency.
Speaking at a rally in January, the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said he had regained control of the local dollar as no country could survive without its own currency.
But the leader of the main opposition party, Nelson Chamisa, also said the use of the national currency would not work.
But an economist, Professor Gift Mugano, says politicians are not the ones who tell the stock market what to do.
The president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers, Denford Mutashu, also acknowledged the sale of foreign exchange.
The head of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce, Chris Mugaga, also said the need to work together for the dollar to work properly.
But Professor Mugano says no dog master has slept in the carrier because even the government has refused to accept the national dollar.
ZCTU secretary general Japhet Moyo also told the employer that things were not going well.
Some economists say the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, RBZ, is in the process of printing money that could keep the country on the brink of collapse.
But RBZ governor, Dr John Mangudya, says this is a lie.
Zimbabwe started using foreign currency, including the US dollar in 2019, but later returned to using only the local dollar last year.
The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee, ZimVac, estimates that 59 percent of Zimbabweans in rural areas are facing starvation from January to July next year.
But in the past month, only about 1 percent of the population needed food in rural areas.
The worst affected areas are Matabeleland North, Masvingo and the Midlands.
Fewsnet, an organization that monitors food security, also says that many city dwellers need help this year as the country's economy deteriorates.
The people who are most affected by the food crisis are residents of Chipinge and Chimanimani where the Cyclone Idai has been hit by a cyclone.
A Chimanimani resident, Joel Dhumakwezu, says his area is receiving food aid from the World Vision organization after those in need of help were registered with the Red Cross.
But they say the unregistered are facing a terrible famine.
Some Gweru residents say they are worried about the spread of coronavirus or Covid-19 following the protection of the city by some local immigrants.
About 120 people have been detained at Gweru Polytechnic since Friday last week.
As many as 30 other people have been detained at Mkoba Teachers' College since yesterday.
These people are among the Zimbabweans being controlled from South Africa and Botswana.
Media secretary Nick Mangwana tweeted that Mkoba Teachers College could accommodate 500 foreign nationals. They also said Gweru Polytechnic is already full.
Resident Ms Enita Nyati told Studio 7 that they feared the spread of coronavirus because some of these people may have been infected and that these people could flee their protected areas.
But another resident, Nyasha Mahwende, said the people should be treated fairly as they are Zimbabweans and relatives and friends of other people.
They also said that in addition to fearing the spread of the disease, they were also concerned that some of these people could be involved in illegal activities and emphasized the need for strong protection.
Studio 7 has been denied access to the two sites by security officials, who say they need permission from the Midlands regional government office.
We have heard from Midlands Minister Larry Mavima and former provincial medical director Dr Reginald Mhene but when we arrived at his office he was said to be in a meeting.
Experts say that in Botswana and South Africa where they were part of the so-called illegal immigrants they were arrested, which put them at risk of contracting coronavirus.
Gweru Mayor Josiah Makombe confirmed to VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe that the coronavirus or Isolation District Hospital is still under construction.
He urged residents to adhere to the guidelines for preventing coronavirus infection but said they should not be afraid, saying they were confident that those who were diagnosed with the virus could be treated.
People's Democratic Party leader Lucia Matibenga, who is also a resident of Gweru, said it was the government's responsibility to keep the returnees safe and to ensure the safety of all other residents.
The Midlands has not yet infected anyone infected with the coronavirus. But the continued repatriation of Zimbabweans from neighboring countries is causing some to shake their heads in fear of the disease.
The president's office on Wednesday held a meeting with doctors on strike for the first time since the doctors began their strike on December 1 last year.
Some senior doctors and specialists or Registrars and Consultants have also gone on strike on Wednesday. Many people in the country say people are losing their lives because of the doctors' strike.
The president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, returned from holiday on Tuesday to join his predecessor, General Constantino Chiwenga, in trying to resolve the doctors' strike.
Spokesman Nick Mangwana said he believed Mnangagwa had returned to work to help put out the blaze.
On Tuesday, Mr Chiwenga had demanded that doctors return to work.
Senior doctors under the Zimbabwe Medical Association have given the government 48 hours to resolve the issue of junior doctors and have gone on strike.
But Mnangagwa's office held a meeting with the leaders of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, Dr Elias Muzoremba, to hear the doctors' grievances.
In a letter to reporters, the doctors told the president's office that they were being misled by the Health Services Board.
The doctors say they want the government to address the issue of drug shortages in hospitals and other facilities and to provide them with US dollars in exchange for RTGS.
These doctors are currently earning $ 329 a month. But this money comes in RTGS.
But an economics professor at Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Professor Gift Mugano, told Studio 7 that the government could not afford the money at all.
We also asked Dr Mugano how since some companies are now charging in US dollars for their products, how can it be improved?
The head of the Community Working Group on Health, Mr Itai Rusike, told Studio 7 that it was important for the government to give the health sector more money in the budget.
Many in the country are also complaining that Health Insurance cards are not working and when buying medicines from pharmacies they are being told to bring in US dollars just to stay home.
The Warriors national soccer team has left for South Africa for the Cosafa tournament.
The team faces two battles in the Cosafa Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations, which they must win decisively starting with the Cosafa Cup on Saturday.
In addition to using the Cosafa Cup as a preparation for the Afcon, Zimbabwe must once again defend the trophy, which it won for the sixth time last year, hoping to strengthen its reputation as a North African football champion again this year.
Due to financial constraints, Zimbabwe has not been able to find teams to play in pre-Afcon qualifiers and Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa says Cosafa is the only way to strengthen his squad.
Chidzambwa is also looking to add to his reputation in the Cosafa tournament after becoming the first coach to win the trophy four times since the tournament was launched in 1997.
Chidzambwa won the Cosafa Cup in 2003, 2009, 2017 and 2018.
Other Zimbabwean players such as Tendai Darikwa, Admiral Muskwe, and Alec Mudimu also want to appear in the Cosafa Cup which they have been feeling unaware of.
This year, Zimbabwe has the strongest team in all of the tournament as it is rocking their team heading to Afcon including other players such as Knowledge Musona, and Marvelous Nakamba.
A member of the Zimbabwe Warriors Fan Club, Shingirai Miti, says there is no competition for Cosafa because the trophy has always been Zimbabwean.
Having won the Cosafa Cup, the Warriors are looking forward to the first pass from their rally at the Afcon tournament in which they face Egypt in their first match.
The club's player, Ronald Pfumbidzai, says they are not going to Egypt to add existing teams.
Zimbabwe is in Group A with Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda where Warriors manager Wellington Mpandare is confident of leaving.
Zimbabwe is leaving South Africa at the end of the Cosafa tournament on June 8 en route to Nigeria on its way to the Afcon in Egypt.
For many athletes, the Christmas holiday season is a time to be with family and friends, while others take this opportunity to do different things. But this year at a time when some are visiting family and friends after a year without seeing each other, FC Platinum coach Lizwe Sweswe and his team are not getting the chance as they are in Cairo, Egypt, in their match against Al Ahly in the Caf Champions League.
This will be FC Platinum's third match in the competition, after being beaten 2-1 by Sudan's Al Hilal in the first leg, losing 3-0 to Tunisia's Etoile duSahel.
Sweswe says they will be at work working in the hope that Christmas will give them the good fortune to win after being beaten in both games. Another football coach, Darlington Dodo of Caps United, says after failing to win the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League trophy, this is the time to make amends where there was no standing. But the head of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee, Anna Mguni, said they headed to their home to see relatives and friends who had not been seen for a long time. Basketball player, Nyarai Musambudzi, has a similar plan to Ms Mguni's but is heading to Masvingo Triangle coach Taurayi Mangwiro says his workplace is so far away from his family that football has now stopped giving time to his family. This is also the case for former World Cup netball player Ursula Ndlovu, who says he has spent so much time in the camp that he will now be with his family and friends in Bulawayo having fun together. But the chairman of the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association, Ringisai Mapondera, says there is nothing better than a volleyball game at Christmas. Mapondera said he would be gathering with family and friends at his home in Harare to play the game in celebration of this time. There are others like Mapondera including boxer Charles Manyuchi, who says they are taking this time to prepare hard for their next season in anticipation of a strong harvest next year.
The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) says it has notified the government that it must resolve its grievances within 14 days, failing which it will go on strike.
The union says it wants teachers' salaries to be in US dollars, or to be paid in the equivalent of five hundred US dollars.
The ARTZ report was presented on Friday in the hands of the government through the civil service, the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
Studio7 has not been able to hear from the government side on the matter, as Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa has not been contacted on her mobile phone.
ARTUZ president, Obert Masaraure, says as coaches, they also want a better life, but it is not happening as they wish.
Masaraure says although the government says it is worried about the economy, it can improve things if it fights corruption in its branches, as well as manages public finances.
Masaraure says much of the government's money is being spent on non-essential services such as foreign trips, car insurance and other things that can be set aside in order to provide better salaries for public servants.
Masaraure says in his view, there is money in the country that can fix the problems, but the problem is that the national treasury is not being managed properly, and they do not see the need to fix things from government officials.
Foreign nationals are complaining about the rising cost of obtaining new passports or renewing existing contracts.
This follows a move by the government on Monday this week to announce that it had given permission to the Registrar-General's Secretary-General to start charging Zimbabweans abroad $ 388 million.
Speaking to reporters, Interior Minister Kazembe Kazembe said his department was aware of the high expectations of people to get their passports as soon as possible, and that people who are struggling to get these documents, especially those abroad, have expired documents.
Kazembe said in order to ensure that foreign nationals have legal documents in their home countries, the government has seen fit to raise the price, and that these documents will be issued immediately.
But some expatriates feel that the government has taken this step to raise foreign exchange.
A passport holder in the country pays an average of $ 53 for the RTGS, while the one who wants to get out within three days is charged $ 250.
Requirements for a passport issued within one day are charged $ 380.
The chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, Kindness Paradza, said his committee strongly supported the move to raise passport fees as a way to help these people create access to their documents, without compromising their residency in their home countries.
Paradza said many expatriates had heard of the theft of relatives and friends and paid large sums of money for their passports.
Isaac Nyaumba, a Zimbabwean national, said he was thrilled to have the opportunity to meet and be photographed by world-renowned footballer Neymar.
Neymar, born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and his full name is Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior.
Neymar is currently playing for Barcelona's Spanish club along with another footballer, Lionel Messi. He also plays for Brazil, who led the Under-23 team to a gold medal for the first time in the Olympics.
But although many say Nyaumba and Neymar's picture was taken in Victoria Falls, they told Studio 7 that it was taken while working at the Ukutula Conservation Center, near Pretoria in South Africa.
The Mighty Warriors women's soccer team is facing a major game in its history, with the public wanting Zimbabwe to win in order to enter the country's sporting history.
The Mighty Warriors are entering Rufaro Stadium on Sunday in their biggest match since 1980 when Zimbabwe began international competition.
The women's soccer team is facing the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon in a match that will determine whether or not Zimbabwe is able to qualify for next year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Mighty Warriors were beaten 2-1 when the two teams met in Yaounde two weeks ago but they only need a 1-0 win to qualify for the World Cup.
After qualifying for the tournament, the Mighty Warriors make it the second team in 35 years to compete in the tournament following the 1980 gold hockey girls.
But the Mighty Warriors go down in history as the first team to compete successfully in the tournament as hockey girls went to Moscow after being invited to the shortlisted teams.
Warriors Fan Club member, Zivanai Moroyiwa, says they are delaying the game saying that the Mighty Warriors will make the public happy by doing what the team or any team has not done in the last 35 years.
Caps United fan Tonderayi Matimura says looking at the Mighty Warriors' performance when the two teams met two weeks ago, they are confident the Mighty Warriors will take control and win again.
The Zimbabwe Football Association has recognized the importance of the public in the game and has arranged for the public to pay a one-dollar fee to watch this important game.
Sports commentator Andrew Rwodzi says more people will be in the stadium as the dollar is a money that everyone can afford to pay to watch this important game.
Mr Matimura said he would also be present at the stadium as the dollar is a cheaper currency than the three dollars that Zifa calls for.
The team's coach, Shadreck Mlauzi, has built a strong team that includes both seniors and juniors and he expects players such as Rudo Neshamba and Rutendo Machingura to set fire to Sunday in front of their supporters.
At the same time the Warriors team will be at Bourfields Stadium where they face Lesotho in the African Nations Championship match which weighs less than the Mighty Warriors match.
The club's coach, Kalisto Pasuwa, sacked three players Hardlife Zvirekwi and Justice Jangano of Caps United and Ronald Chitiyo of Dynamos on sexual offenses but Muroyiwa said the Warriors did not stop small teams like Lesotho.
The Warrriors are hoping to win two games between the two teams to advance to the finals of the African Nations Championships for the fourth time in a row after qualifying for the 2009, 2012 and 2014 tournaments.
But the eyes and minds of the public are on the Mighty Warriors game.
Street vendors in Harare's interior and members of the Tajamuka / Sesijikile movement have joined forces to fight against the city police and the Zimbabwe Republic Police, who have reportedly forcibly evicted them from their businesses.
The same thing happened in the town of Norton, where street vendors reportedly refused to be evicted while selling at Katanga.
Tajamuka / Sesijikile spokesperson, Makomborero Haruzivishe, said some of the street vendors were members of his organization who were constantly harassed by the police.
Haruzivishe said by the time we went on air they were still at the police station to try to determine how many people had been arrested in the incident, but said they were aware of one person.
Harare City Council spokesman Michael Chideme said they had not heard of the incident as they were not in town during the day.
But the government, through the Ministry of Information, posted a message on Twitter stating that many youths had been stoned to death by police.
The government has also said it has video evidence of the teenagers stabbing police officers, which will be used in court to impale the detainees.
We have not been able to hear from the police on the matter.
The Zimbabwe Community in South Africa, an organization representing Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa, says it is deeply concerned about the increase in robberies in Johannesburg's suburbs, which are being perpetrated by suspected Zimbabweans.
The group says the crimes, mainly in Hillbrow, Berea and Yeoville, are home to many foreign nationals, including Zimbabweans, including kidnappers, kidnappers, stabbed and murderers.
Zimbabwe Community in South Africa spokesperson Bongani Mkwananzi said they were planning to meet with the police to raise the issue, and to urge the police to take serious action.
He said February 6, which will be next month, his organization is looking forward to meeting with the police in charge of the provinces to work together to address the problem.
They also say that the police should be patrolling the area, but they are often unavailable, which will lead to thieves and robbers doing Jojina's bidding.
Mr Mkwananzi said many of the victims knew of some of the perpetrators in their own language, so the police who are committed to the crime should be working with Zimbabweans living in these areas.
Others who have spoken to Studio7 are also advocating for the deployment of troops in these areas in order to stop these crimes.
South Africans have long accused foreign nationals of increasing crime, drug trafficking, and prostitution.
Many people say that the year 2019 will mark the beginning of a difficult political and economic year for the country.
The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Dormaa East, Mr Paul Apraku Twum Barimah, has filed an urgent question in Parliament to demand the cost of chartered flights that former President John Mahama used for his overseas travels from 2013 and 2017.
He said the question, which was directed to the Minister of Finance, Mr Ken Ofori-Attah, would help him and Ghanaians to seek data to support ongoing discussions in the public domain concerning presidential chartered flights by the former president.
“I have filed the question to also understand how much it cost this country between 2013 to 2017 when former President Mahama was on series of travels using chartered flights,” he said.
No equalisation
Throwing light on his aim for filing the urgent question, which is currently in the Speaker’s Office, Mr Barimah said his question had no political connotation.
“It is about time we took a decision as a country on chartered presidential flights and we can only take such decision when we know the trend, which must be established from what has been done previously.
“Has there been a precedence? And if there is a precedence, what was done? And is there an official guideline to these presidential travels? So clearly, I do not want to achieve any political equalisation,” he said.
He added: “I only want us to have a proper debate and discourse so that we can make proper references. Today, it might be my government but tomorrow it will be somebody’s government, so if we do not seek proper clarification and end these back and forth travels, we will always find ourselves in this situation,” he stated.
Ablakwa’s urgent question
The Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, also filed an urgent question in Parliament demanding that the government explains why President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo did not use the presidential aircraft for a recent trip to France.
According to the National Democratic Congress (NDC) North Tongu Member of Parliament (MP), "It is an outrage and a blatant betrayal for Ghana to own a presidential aircraft in perfect working condition" and charter aircraft for presidential travel.”
He also estimated that the President's trip cost in excess of GH¢2 million.
The Bono East Regional Minister, Mr Kwasi Adu-Gyan, has commended the regional leadership of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) for their cooperation towards peace in the region.
“I am proud and extremely excited to see the NPP and the NDC in Bono East working together peacefully, in resolving the political impasse between them,” he said.
Mr Adu-Gyan said peace created an enabling environment for development to thrive and added that without peace it would be difficult for development to progress in the region.
The regional minister gave the commendation in a statement issued after a forum in Techiman.
The forum was attended by representatives of the NPP and the NDC, representatives of traditional authorities, security agencies, the Electoral Commission (EC), the National Commission or Civic Education (NCCE) and civil society organisations (CSOs).
The forum, which was organised by the National Peace Council with sponsorship from the Commonwealth Secretariat, was on the theme: “Countering Post 2020 Election Violence, and Building Consensus for Greater Political Tolerance in Ghana”.
Topics discussed centred on dealing with election-related violence and resolving election-related complaints and disputes.
Mr Adu-Gyan said Ghanaians ought to be proud of the country being ranked the second most peaceful in Africa by the Global Peace Index Report 2021, and underlined the importance for the NPP and the NDC to collectively help to preserve and strengthen the prevailing peace in the country.
“This achievement is a collective effort of the chiefs, political parties, security services, as well as the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary and the media,” he said.
He gave an assurance that the Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) would ensure the required peace needed for development was maintained.
In a presentation on Electoral Justice, the Executive Secretary of the Bono Regional Peace Council, Alhaji Suallah Abdallah Quandah, said electoral justice played a decisive role in ensuring the stability of the political system in the country.
“The role of electoral justice, although not new, has become recognised as a crucial factor in all democracies, whether emerging or established,” it said and explained electoral justice was a prerequisite for preventing political and election violence.
Alhaji Quandah stressed the need for periodic review of the nation’s electoral justice system to ensure it fulfilled its function of guaranteeing free, fair and credible elections.
The MP for Abuakwa South Samuel Atta Akyea has assured Ghanaians a Nana Akufo-Addo-led government will ameliorate their plight when the NPP takes over power from January 7, 2017.
According to him, Ghanaians will experience economic freedom under the leadership of Nana Akufo-Addo due to prudent economic policies that will be rolled out.
“January 7 will be a new era which is going to bring our prosperity and our freedom, especially economic freedom which Ghanaians are craving. Ghanaians are going to notice that God has saved the country from hardship,” Atta Akyea said during a donation to Asiakwa SOS in the East Akim Municipality in the Eastern region.
He said he is ready to serve in a ministerial capacity should he be offered one by President-elect Nana Akufo-Addo.
Some of the items he presented include seven bags of rice, cooking oils, salt, sugar, milk, drinks and undisclosed amount of money.
Three sisters who slept in their mother’s drinking spot have been found dead at Tarkwa-Nsuta in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem municipality in the Western region.
The three died after inhaling fumes from a generator.
Chief Inspector George Sekyi of the Tarkwa-Nsuta station office said on December 18, he received a call that three children had died in a drinking spot.
He said he and his officers rushed to the scene but were told that the deceased Abena Amos, 15, Arabi Dadzi, 13 and Akaba Dadzi, 7, have already been deposited at the Tarkwa Government Hospital morgue awaiting autopsy.
In an interview with Starr News’ Emmanuel Ohene Gyan Mr. Sekyi said the deceased lived with their mother, who operates the ‘Golden City Kitchen’ drinking spot in the Tarkwa Nsuem municipality.
He said they decided to pass the night in the drinking bar after they assisted their mother to sell beverages.
The station officer said on December 17, there was a power outage as result of a heavy downpour that occurred during the day and  because of that Madam Dadzi put a generator in the bar to enable the deceased have access to light as they  slept. The mother of the girls later found them dead when she went to the shop the next morning.
A fourth sister who was also found unconscious is receiving medical treatment. Police in the area are investigating the incident.
lagbearer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) John Mahama says he will pursue the Chief Executive Officer for Menzgold Nana Appiah Mensah popularly known as NAM 1, to retrieve held up investment of customers if he wins the December polls.
Speaking at Tarkwa-Nsuaem in the Western Region, Mr Mahama wondered why the Akufo-Addo government does not appear to be interested in confiscating the properties of NAM1 but rather venting their anger on customers.
“What is so special about NAM 1 that Akufo-Addo is shielding him? Why do you unleash the police on innocent customers while NAM 1 walks free,” he fumed.
He assured that his next government will thoroughly investigate NAM1 and his directors and use all legitimate means to retrieve the funds.
he Circuit Court in Accra presided over by Her Honour Ellen Asamoah on September 7 adjourned the case in which Chief Executive officer (CEO) of Menzgold Nana Appiah Mensah (NAM1) has been adjourned to October 1, 2020.
The State had previously on June 24, 2020, filed new charges against NAM 1 at the Accra Circuit Court.
Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Sylvester Asare then told the Court that his directives were that he should hold on to the new charges and the plea taking of the accused.
On July 20, ASP Asare told the court that, they were seriously working to advise the court on the matter.
To this end, he prayed the court for a long adjournment after which they would have been able to advise the court on their intention of prosecution on the matter.
He said when the advice is ready, they will issue hearing notice to the accused persons to appear before the court to to do the needful.
But in court on Monday, prosecutor prayed for an adjournment and it was granted.
The accused person NAM 1 was present in court.
The Circuit Court on July 26, 2019 granted NAM 1 bail in the sum of GH¢ 1 billion cedis with five sureties, three to be justified.
He had pleaded not guilty to all initial 13 charges levelled against him by the State. The state had since amended its charged sheet which is yet to be moved.
He is also to report to the police every Wednesday at 10:00 hours.
He was initially charged with abetment of crime, defrauding by false pretences, carrying on a deposit-taking business without licence, sale of minerals without licence, unlawful deposit-taking, and money laundering.
It is alleged that the accused had taken various sums of money, totalling GH¢1.6 billion from customers.
The surge in the use of Okada for commercial purposes is increasingly becoming worrying.
The police have also indicated an increase in incidents of crime, accidents, and violations of road traffic regulations involving motorcycles.
Without any doubt, the Okada menace is getting out of hand and something drastic needs to be done to inject sanity into its operations.
We have on countless occasions raised serious concerns about the use of Okada.
At this moment, the nation is clearly confronted with the challenge of dealing with the usage of motorbikes and tricycles, especially for commercial purposes.
Parliament in 2012 passed the Road Traffic Regulations, 2012 (L.I. 2180) into law to regulate road transport in the country. 
Among other things, Regulation 128 under sections one to four (Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 2180) outlaws the use of motorbikes popularly referred to as ‘Okada’ and tricycles for commercial purposes except for courier and delivery services. It also directs the licensing authority not to register a motorcycle to carry a fare-paying passenger.
This legislation, notwithstanding, okada and tricycle (pragya) have taken over the transportation system in many parts of the country. 
In the rural communities, the okada and pragya come in handy as the only means of transport to markets, health facilities and other towns, among other places.
For people in the cities, they are able to beat the heavy traffic by patronizing the bikes. 
The bikes also serve as a cheap source of transportation as they are less expensive. 
They also come in handy because of the absence of an efficient and reliable public transport system.
However, many people abhor okada and pragya because of the nuisance they create on the roads and most particularly the lack of respect for traffic regulations.
The high incidence of accidents and fatalities associated with the reckless use of Okada, is also disturbing.
Indeed, many organisations, including the Ghana Medical Association and the National Road Safety Authority, have called for a total ban on their usage as a mode of transport in the country.
This has left the country in a deep-blue sea. 
This is because, despite the existence of the law banning their use for commercial purposes, they are a major source of relief to many Ghanaians.
For us at the Daily Graphic, we think that the country should relook at the law comprehensively and come up with the most appropriate measures that will suit the needs of the population in line with best practice. 
In India, for instance, pragya is a major means of transport but we have not heard of complaints as we have in Ghana. 
So, what can we learn from India and introduce it into our system?
We need to bear in mind that with the increasing rate of unemployment, the okada and tricycle operators see it as a source of income which caters for them and their families.
But as of now, okadas and pragyas are a nuisance and we at the Daily Graphic believe that with education, regulation and enforcement of the appropriate regimes, the operators must be made to conform if it is established that the country cannot do without them.
In reviewing the current law or system under which they operate, professional training, a licensing regime both for the rider and motorcycle/motor tricycles as well an insurance cover to cater for accidents will be most appropriate.
With such a system in place, it will be easier for the Ghana Police Service to enforce the law and also deal with unregistered motorbikes and motor tricycles as well as those involved in criminal activities.
Currently, Ghanaians are divided over the regularisation of these two major means of transport because of their advantages and disadvantages.
The Daily Graphic believes that if we want to have decency on our roads and improve our transportation system, then we have to comprehensively hold the bull by the horn and address the problem now or never.
I don’t recall a happier day in my recent memory in Ghana than last Friday, the Green Ghana day. 
This was the day that we were all urged to go out and plant a tree. 
Since I came back to Ghana 20 years ago and to the realisation that the reality of our country was very different from what was in the Geography books, this was the most successful attempt at doing something to reverse the catastrophic degradation of our lands.
Five million seedlings were made available by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for us to plant and there was a joyful atmosphere that I hadn’t noticed for a long time.
It might well be that enough Ghanaians had noticed that the one thing that needed our attention more than anything else was the state of the land mass that we call Ghana.
Far more than any potholed road, any dilapidated school, any hospital without beds or any schoolchildren without computers and I daresay, even the worst of any rampaging virus, what we should all get and remain agitated about is the state of our land, the land that had lost its forest cover, the rivers that are drying up, what used to be a wet month of May turning out hot and totally dry.
I haven’t taken a look at the Geography textbooks that are being used in our schools today, but I do know that the characteristics of the land mass of Ghana in the books I used at school certainly do not look like present day Ghana.
We still talk about dense tropical forests, but that is not the reality of our lands. 
We still talk about wild animals but they had been hunted down and their habitats taken over long ago.
The dense tropical forests and wild animals now exist only as part of our language and not part of our reality. 
Even what we thought were forest reserves have been shown to have been hollowed out in the search for gold and other minerals.
Maybe our reality got through to most of us and I am hoping that those who did not take part had very good reasons not to have done so.
To my mind, if anyone or group of people need to be named and shamed in today’s Ghana, it is those who did not bother to go and get a seedling and plant last Friday.
If you see it fit to comment on anything and everything, on things that are going wrong, on unpaved roads, on Free SHS, on the rate of borrowing, on the absence of street lights and even on Supreme Court rulings and you did not plant a tree last Friday, you should be ashamed of yourself, even if you are not named and shamed publicly.
I would suggest though that it is not too late to redeem yourself if you happen to fall in this category.
Planting seedlings and having them grow into the beautiful and majestic  trees that we need to cover our land is a long term undertaking. 
Having planted the seedlings, they need to be tended and nurtured and it takes time and hard work.
Last Friday, it rained in Accra, (and I hear in many other parts of the country) which was enough to make a believer of me, considering how dry it had been.
The seedlings need to be watered regularly if the rains don’t come. Under normal circumstances, a better date couldn’t have been chosen than June 11 for the mass planting, but things aren’t what they used to be with our weather and our land and therefore the seedlings might need more care than they otherwise would have needed.
If you missed planting last Friday, you can still plant one or two and you can certainly help look after those that have been planted.
Cutting down a tree takes so little time, but growing a tree to full maturity to attain its regal and intimidating status takes years.
If we are to restore this land of ours to the ‘dense tropical forest’ described in the Geography books and in the songs of our festivals, then, as President Akufo-Addo said, Greening Ghana will have to become a regular and integral part of our activities.
That presupposes, of course, that we shall stop degrading the lands in the first place, give them some breathing space to rejuvenate and then when we plant, the trees can grow in peace.
I probably also have to declare an interest here. I am a child of the forest, I was born in a forest area, even though the place no longer qualifies as a forest area.
I adore trees, there is nothing that can replace the experience of an afternoon heavy rainfall in a thick forest and the sweet smell that arises from the soil after the rain.
Every child must have the opportunity to experience it and to look up and around trees that are older than their great grandparents.
Another personal declaration of interest is that one of my very favourite people in this world is the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, Samuel Abu Jinapor, the Honourable Member of Parliament for Damongo.
Once upon a time when you were appointed a Minister of Mineral Resources, it was a beautiful job, now you are dealing with the degradation of lands, the pollution of rivers and having to burn excavators.
I want Ghana to be returned to a land of thick forests, majestic trees, clean and beautiful rivers and I want it to happen under the tenure of Minister Abu Jinapor.
I couldn’t quite decide what to make of him in that Rangers uniform last Friday but I could certainly see the amount of hard work that had gone into the planning and execution of the project. I am wishing him well and I am hoping that every one of the seedlings that was planted last Friday survives and thrives.
A green Ghana will be a prosperous Ghana.
When it comes to good music, Highlife musician Akwaboah cannot be ignored, but he will easily skip your mind when you are talking about A List musicians in Ghana and that is because he is not in our faces all the time.
However, the musician is not worried that he is not at the top of people’s list. He told Graphic Showbiz that he was not in competition with any musician and not being in the public eye all the time allowed him room to release quality songs.
According to Akwaboah, releasing songs back to back just to help keep an artiste’s name out there did not guarantee sustainability.
“I don’t rush to release songs because I want to take my time and get it right. So many musicians made hits but in just a short time, they were nowhere to be found. I don’t want to be that kind of artiste. I am not under any pressure to release hit songs and anytime I drop something new, Ghanaians just love it.
 “It is always not the best to keep releasing hit after hit. Ghanaians are some way and if they decide not to pay attention to you again, there is nothing you will do to impress them. I prefer to stay this way for the next 15 years than to do hit after hit songs and be forgotten in a year or two,” he told Graphic Showbiz recently.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police has launched a campaign aimed at preventing violence against women and girls, especially during elections.
Police launched the campaign on Wednesday with the support of human rights organizations, especially women's rights, the Canadian embassy in Zimbabwe, and the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe.
Speaking at the rally, the police chief, Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga, said the police would not be complacent in matters of violence against women during elections.
He also urged women to report cases of violence or abuse without fear.
The chairperson of the Women's Coalition of Zimbabwe, Sally Ncube, also said she was impressed by the police's commitment to prevent violence against women during elections.

Some doctors in the country at hospitals such as the West End and Parirenyatwa are refusing to treat people suspected of having coronavirus because they do not have the expertise and expertise.
On Monday, some nurses also protested at Mpilo Hospital, saying they did not have the necessary protection against the disease.
The Ministry of Infectious Diseases in the Ministry of Health, Dr Portia Manangazira, also told Studio7 that a Zimbabwean woman from China had failed to receive treatment in Parirenyatwa.
Parirenyatwa Hospital later investigated the case and ruled that it would not transmit the disease to patients such as coronaviruses, saying such people should be legally referred to Wilkins Hospital and Beatrice Infectious Hospital as a way of trying to prevent other patients and doctors at the hospital from being infected with coronavirus.
The hospital also said it would set up a tent outside the hospital to screen those suspected of having the disease and then refer them to the so-called specialist hospitals.
Harare City Council's chief medical officer, Dr Prosper Chonzi, also said that the West End hospital refused to help a Chinese woman who died thinking she had coronavirus but did not.
When we phoned the hospital they asked us to send questions but we had not yet received a response when we went on air.
Some 3,882 people have died from the disease worldwide.
China has the highest death toll, followed by Italy and Iran. In Africa two people have died in Egypt and Morocco.
But 11 countries in Africa have been affected, namely Algeria, Burkina Faso, South Africa, Senegal, Tunisia, Togo, Egypt, Cameroon, DRC, Nigeria and Morocco. South Africa has 13 people infected with the virus.
Harare City Council is warning residents of Budiriro and Glen Norah communities not to use water from wells or wells they are digging as the water is contaminated.
Due to the frequent lack of tap water, residents in areas such as Glen Norah and Budiriro, are using well water.
But council spokesman Michael Chideme said a study conducted in Budiriro village by Glen Norah found that many mines were contaminated with diarrheal diseases such as typhoid fever.
Mr Chideme said most of the mines being used in the area were shallow, which would lead to the severity of the sewers.
Chideme said the council is providing water to these areas on a regular basis.
The head of the Community Water Alliance, Mr Hardlife Mudzingwa, criticized the council saying the lack of council water was the main reason for residents to mine mines.
Mr Mudzingwa also said some areas do not always get water.
Many residents of Harare do not have regular access to council water which has led to mining in mining villages even though it is not permitted by council regulations.
Residents also say that although the council's water is very dirty, they are also worried about their health.
Things are not going well in public hospitals as the children's nurse is not doing their job.
Patients at Parirenyatwa Hospital told Studio7 that they were shocked by the government-sponsored gathering of people in various parts of the country as patients picked ants by mouth from hospitals.
Shupikai Gachitawa has a child with a broken leg at Parirenyatwa Hospital. Ms Gachitawa says her child is not being given pills or baths and new bandages due to the lack of a nurse.
Ms Gachitawa said the government should listen to the cries of its people and arrange for nurses to return to work.
Innocent Mazise has since seen his patient criticize the government for taking action to expel child nurses who are on strike. Mr Mazise said the government should look into the nurses' grievances and not rule with an ax.
A man who did not want to be named told Studio7 that the wards are no longer clean as there are no bathers or cleaners. He also said that patients are losing their lives due to the lack of any pills and medicines and helpers.
One mother has demanded anonymity because Ms Gumbo has said she is planning to evacuate her patient from the hospital who she says has not been given medication and pills since Monday.
The secretary of the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights, Evans Masitara, said the government's decision to dismiss the nurses was "disgraceful", as they were suffering from the disease.
In a written statement to its members, the Zimbabwe Nurses Association said they were not alarmed by any action being taken by the government. The report also said that the strike was continuing.
Yesterday, Deputy President Constantino Guvheya Chiwenga filed a letter dismissing all striking nurses.
A propaganda video released last month by the Islamic State (IS) group shows the Sahel's appeal to global jihadism when "brothers" in Burkina Faso and Mali were congratulated for pledging their allegiance.
Ansarul Islam, meaning Defenders of Islam, is the home-grown group, founded in 2016 by the radical and popular preacher Ibrahim Malam Dicko, who is said to have fought with Islamist militants in Mali when they took over the north of country in 2012, prompting France's intervention.
Dicko died in April 2017 and his brother Jafar is now leading the group, which has received logistical support from both AQIM and ISGS, according to Human Rights Watch.
Widespread frustration with the lack of jobs and infrastructure has made Burkina Faso a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists - and there are numerous smaller groups, not all of which are affiliated to larger ones or pledge allegiance to Islamist ideology.
According to the Economist, many are fighting for farmland or against government corruption but "adopt the 'jihadist' label because they happen to be Muslim".
But Ncube said members of parliament should trust the government as they improve the banking system and the use of funds in the country for the benefit of the people.
He said there were many steps they were taking that would make things better in the country.
Kwekwe Central MP Masango Matambanadzo also told Ncube that the issue of separating the weight of bonds from the US dollar had made it difficult for many in the country.
He said it was important for the government to see what it could do to increase the salaries of its employees and the private sector in order to keep pace with rising costs.
But Mr Ncube said the government had already adjusted the salaries of its employees and that was why it was providing them with benefits.
They also know that workers in the private sector are also getting higher salaries.
But Mr Matambanadzo said increased wages were useless because commodity prices had risen sharply.
But Mr. Ncube said he would not increase workers' wages in line with the US dollar, saying that although prices were rising, prices of other commodities were falling because they were being bought by fewer people.
He said it was clear that businesses were buying foreign currency on the street but that they should buy the money from banks.
He said banks currently have $ 800 million in foreign currency and this is the amount to be spent by industries and companies.
In a separate development, Chipinge East MP Matthew Mlambo said he was unhappy that the 2000 resettlers had been evicted for no reason.
He said this was happening in many parts of the country.
Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Douglas Karoro, said the evictees were those living in unsuitable places such as cattle grazing or barns.
There are many families who have been evicted from farms given to them by the government many years ago in Chemagora in the Midlands and Mashonaland West and freedom fighters are also complaining about this issue.
The MDC, led by Nelson Chamisa, says it did not attend the meeting convened by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, because Mnangagwa himself is the cause of the unrest in the country.
The MDC says Mr Mnangagwa should not convene a rally to mediate between the two parties if he is a member of the party.
Responding to an invitation to a meeting with the president's office, the MDC's chief of staff, Sessel Zvizvai, said his leader could not attend the meeting, as there were many issues that needed to be resolved.
Mr Zvizvai said the outcome of the presidential election was one of the first issues to be considered.
He also said that the issue of dialogue should be convened by non-political actors so that reconciliation can be done in a way that is fair to all.
Mr Zvizvai also said the talks should be supported by organizations including the Souther African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations.
The MDC has named 10 candidates for Mnangagwa before the talks with Chamisa.
These include stopping harassment of opponents; ensuring that no one is raped; the release from prison of all political prisoners; non-political interference in the functioning of the judiciary and respect for human rights.
The party's spokesman, Jacob Mafume, told Studio7 that before the reconciliation meeting, Mnangagwa should withdraw troops from the streets and allow other members of the opposition who had fled the country to return home from their homeland.
Three key Islamist militant groups have established a front in northern and eastern Burkina Faso: Ansarul Islam, the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (GSIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).
One of the most audacious attacks of recent years - the January 2016 siege on a luxury hotel that killed 30 people in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou - was carried out by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has since merged with two other jihadist groups - Ansar Dine and al-Mourabitoun - to form GSIM
Manyuchi who owns the WBO Silver belt told Studio 7 that Ali's absence has left a gaping hole as he has made the public enjoy the sport of boxing. "A man who had this talent, my father was also a boxer who liked him and I respected him as he was the one who made me strong in this sport." said Manyuchi.
He went on to say, "Muhammad Ali was known for saying - float like a butterfly and sting like a bee," I am known as a busy bee as my name is beehive so I feel happy that my band was also fought by Muhammad Ali because it has a picture of him and is the target category, I'm sorry but I will continue to use the skills I gained through Muhammad Ali, "
International leaders, including former US President Bill Clinton and other foreign leaders, are expected to attend. Many deputies are expected to say goodbye to Ali this Friday. Roads are expected to be very congested.
Ali's family said when the funeral procession was over, everyone would go alone as a family to bury the deceased. 
A spokesman for the family, Bob Gunnell, said Ali's funeral was scheduled years ago based on the deceased's wishes. He is said to have wanted his grievances to be brought to the attention of anyone who wished.
Ali was born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. in 1942 but later changed his date after converting from being a Christian to a Muslim. 
He also won a gold medal in the light heavy weight category after defeating Zbigniew Pietrkowski of Poland.
Many American companies are considering the problem of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) as a major factor that has led many workers to work in their own homes, as a way to prevent the spread of the disease.
Other companies with jobs that cannot be employed at home, including food processors, have reportedly suspended some employees as they are unable to go to the offices.
Many states in the United States have banned the gathering of people in places including restaurants and movie theaters, prompting many workers in these service groups to be suspended until things improve.
The US government has also announced plans to set aside $ 1 trillion, which will be used to boost the country's economy by helping companies and individuals affected by the disease.
More than 6,000 people have been infected in the United States and more than 100 have died.
A Zimbabwean national living in the state of Maryland in the United States, Ms. Shingie Mangwiro, who is also working from home due to the disease, says she feels that the idea of ​​living at home is a good idea as it helps reduce social unrest.
Ms. Mangwiro, who sometimes works from home when there are other problems, says she has no problem with utilities as her home appliances are always connected to the workplace.
They also say that the steps being taken by US President Donald Trump and other government agencies are more appropriate in tackling the problem.
But Ms. Mangwiro is also urging those at home to prioritize sanitation, saying that although the disease has not yet entered the country, it is important that people take steps to prevent it.
Homeless people following the floods of the Tokwe Murkosi dam in Masvingo district last year say life is still difficult for them as they are no longer receiving assistance from the government and NGOs.
The announcement was made at the launch of a report outlining the plight of these people.
Speaking at the end of the launch of the Human Rights Watch charter, which conducted a social survey at Nuanetsi Ranch, some of the homeless following the floods said they were unhappy that the government had not yet provided them with shelter a year after the floods.
One of the victims, Kundiso Tevera, claims to have been abducted by the government. He said when they were relocated to Nuanetsi it was too small for all the families affected by the floods to do anything.
Ms. Tevera said one of the problems was the spread of diarrheal diseases which she said were caused by the unsafe water she said they were getting from the boreholes which she said were far from Nuanetsi Ranch when they were given land to live on.
Meanwhile, one of the victims, Wanisai Muzenda, said food was a problem for many displaced people in Tokwe Mukorsi, saying many people were starving due to the suspension of food aid from NGOs.
Ms Muzenda says the person is living with the virus, so the lack of food in the resettlement area has prevented them from taking their pills and says they are already dying.
One of the men, Kenneth Hlavano, a former soldier, said he was saddened by the fact that he had been evacuated three times since the floods for free.
Meanwhile, Dewa Mavhinga, working with the Human Rights Watch evacuation team, urged the Human Rights Commission to investigate the ongoing evictions in Tokwe Murkosi and the ongoing human rights abuses.
We have not been able to hear the government's side of the story as Masvingo provincial minister Kudakwashe Bhasikiti has not responded to phone calls and interior minister Kembo Mohadi has been returning questions to Basikiti.
Mavhinga urged the victims to take their cases to court. 
Mavhinga was speaking at the launch of his organization's report on the evacuation of Tokwe Murkosi following last year's floods called "Homeless, Landless and Destitute - The Plight of Zimbabwe's Tokwe Mukorsi Flood Victims".
A report released by Human Rights Watch is urging the government to rehabilitate more than 20,000 flood victims and reimburse them.
The group is also urging the African Union to ensure that Zimbabwe protects human rights. President Robert Mugabe is the current chair of the AU.
The coach of the national senior and junior team, KalistoPasuwa, has resigned.
Pasuwa resigned yesterday when the Young Warriors returned from South Africa where they were beaten 3-0.
Pasuwa has told the Zimbabwe Football Association that he will not continue to work without pay, which he has not been paid for 10 months.
Pasuwa's manager, Gibson Mahachi, says Pasuwa has resigned and is looking forward to more work to come.
Rumors are circulating in Harare that Pasuwa may return to Dynamos after the sacking of David Mandigora as the club's coach.
Former Warriors kit manager Joshua Khumalo, who was unpaid during his tenure, says Pasuwa has taken a positive step instead of working for free.
Khumalo said he was surprised that Fifa was not paying its employees while receiving funding from Fifa for support.
Football commentator Prosper Muzanharwo said the beating of the Young Warriors in South Africa had nothing to do with their performance but that they were starving because of Zifa's lack of funding.
Sports commentator Howard Musonza said Zifa had failed so badly that they should be fired if they failed to pay their employers.
The Young Warriors will travel to the Africa Games in Congo Brazaville in September with a new coach, Nation Dube, who was Pasuwa's successor.
The Warriors will also have a new coach when they play Guinea in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in early September.
Church members are gathering in Harare to pray for a solution to the crisis, with President Emmerson Mnangagwa calling for unity among political parties.
The internet has been shut off and a curfew imposed in Eswatini, the southern African kingdom formerly known as Swaziland.
Security forces are on high alert as protesters demanding political reforms have vowed to step up their demonstrations.
A journalist told the BBC that overnight there were violent confrontations in the city of Manzini and that the country’s borders and airport remain closed.
Days of protests have left several people in hospital, businesses in the capital, Mbabane, remain closed after some, including those linked to the king, were destroyed.
Sporadic demonstrations over poor wages and political repression have flared up over the years in Eswatini - this most recent one was sparked by the death of law student.
While the government says his death was the result of a car accident, protesters say he was murdered by police.
The protests have highlighted long-running discontent in one of the world’s last remaining absolute monarchies.
King Mswati III, who came to the throne 35 years ago, rules by decree.
His critics accuse the 53-year-old monarch, and his 15 wives, of leading a lavish lifestyle and treating opponents harshly.
A court in Morocco is reported to have sentenced an Italian-Moroccan woman to three and a half years in prison for insulting Islam after she shared a post on Facebook of a satirical text imitating Quranic verse.
The father of the 23-year-old woman says that she was arrested at the airport in the capital, Rabat, on her return from France where she was studying.
A religious association in Marrakesh instigated the case against her by making a complaint to the authorities.
Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo has ordered a public inquiry into the shooting dead of two protesters.
Four others were injured during clashes with the security forces in the central town of Ejura on Tuesday.
The disturbances began after popular government critic Ibrahim Mohammed, also known as “Macho Kaaka”, was beaten up over the weekend in Ejura and subsequently died.
Demonstrators blocked the main road after his burial on Tuesday, the police said.
Security personnel deployed to restore calm were threatened with firearms, machetes and stones, the police statement adds.
The protesters were killed when security personnel opened fire.
A top Liberian drug enforcement officer has apologised for making allegations that an MP was caught transporting drugs.
The officer told a drug awareness forum about her encounter with an MP who, she said, was seen carrying marijuana, cocaine and heroin in his official vehicle.
She declined to name the MP at the time.
But the allegation was published widely in local dailies and on social media, prompting the 73-member parliament to summon the officer to disclose the name of the MP in question.
When she appeared before the house, the officer admitted making the allegation but refused to point out the MP and instead asked for forgiveness.
The hearing was adjourned as the officer was rushed to hospital after suddenly falling ill.
Substance abuse is a huge challenge in post-war Liberia, where the under-funded Drug Enforcement Agency struggles to tackle the drug trade.
Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has downplayed Monday’s capture by rebels of the Tigrayan regional capital, Mekelle.
"A lot of people were shocked… when we started withdrawing from Mekelle. But, by the time we exited, there was nothing special about it,” he said.
“It had lost its centre of gravity in the current context."
But the rebels insist the federal forces had been beaten and were forced to leave.
Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Redwan Hussein said the military could retake Mekelle in three weeks if necessary.
The government had other economic priorities to deal with, he said.
More than $2.2bn (£1.6bn) had been spent by the government over the past eight months in Tigray in efforts to provide aid, he added.
Fighting has been going on since November, leaving thousands of people dead and destabilising the region.
The UN has appealed for urgent access to vulnerable people in Tigray, many of whom face starvation.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders saw Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election.
The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew when the central government suspended funding for Tigray and cut ties with it in October. 
At the time, Tigray's administration said this amounted to a "declaration of war".
Tensions increased, and the eventual catalyst was when Tigrayan forces were accused of attacking army bases to steal weapons.
Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a "red line".
"The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation," he said.
Algerian Finance Minister Ayman Benabderrahmane has been appointed as the new prime minister following parliamentary elections earlier this month that were marred by a low turnout
Mr Benabderrahmane, who was also once the central bank governor, now has to try to form a government to tackle the North African nation’s economic crisis.
Reforms promised by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune when he took office 18 months ago have been hampered by the sharp drop in oil and gas revenues and the coronavirus pandemic.
The main Islamist party, the MSP - which came third in the election - has said it will not participate in the new government.
The new prime minister will also have to respond to the demands of an influential popular protest movement - known as the Hirak - calling for radical political change.
It brought to an end the long-time rule of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in 2019.
The Hirak called for a boycott of the recent elections and continues to hold weekly demonstrations in various parts of the country.
Dozens of its members have been prosecuted and jailed, according to human rights groups.
Namibia’s President Hage Geingob has said his country is facing a “dark and sombre moment” as coronavirus deaths and cases rapidly increase.
Addressing the nation, he said that 513 Namibians had died in the last 15 days as a result of the virus and cases have trebled since the beginning of June.
With a population of just 2.5 million this represents one of the worst death rates on the continent.
Introducing new restrictions, including stopping movement between the country’s regions, Mr Geingob said that things were likely to continue to get worse until mid-August at the earliest.
Speaking after the president, Health Minister Kalumbi Shangula said the country was “literally in an existential struggle… we are in a fight for our very lives”.
He described a stretched health service and said that the country’s mortuaries “have reached maximum capacity”.
The minister announced that more intensive care beds were being prepared and steps had been taken to boost the country’s purified oxygen supply.
Rounding off his message, President Geingob urged people to co-operate with the new measures and insisted the nation would overcome the crisis.
A man extradited to Rwanda from the Netherlands has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for genocide crimes committed when he was 19.
During Jean-Claude Iyamuremye’s five-year trial, he denied involvement in the 1994 genocide when around 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in 100 days by Hutu extremists.
The high court judge said Iyamuremye had been a member of a youth militia that hunted and killed members of the Tutsi community in his neighbourhood in the capital, Kigali.
The 45-year-old defended himself, saying his own mother was a Tutsi.
The judge said he could have sentenced Iyamuremye to life, but had decided not to as he was “so young” when the crimes were committed and he had also saved some Tutsi families.
Iyamuremye was arrested in 2013 in the Netherlands, where he had worked as a driver for staff at the Israeli and Finnish embassies.
He was sent back to Rwanda by the Dutch authorities in 2016.
Two suspected jihadists have been arrested over the Solhan attack in the north-eastern region of Burkina Faso on 4 June in which more than 130 people were killed.
The prosecutor announced the arrest of two suspects, aged 28, in a statement.
Both claim to belong to the Mouhadine group, meaning "People in Solidarity", which is thought to be affiliated to al-Qaeda.
It is divided into several sub-groups based in Burkina Faso and has led incursions into Niger and Benin.
The prosecutor said the the group was responsible for previous attacks in Solhan, Sebba, Boundoré and Koholoko on the Niger border.
The prosecutor has requested the opening of a judicial investigation into the two suspects on a number of terrorism-related charges.
The attack on the village of Solhan, which took place at an artisanal mining site, is considered to be the deadliest attack in Burkina Faso since April 2015.
It has caused discontent and criticism about the ability of the defence and security forces to contain jihadist violence in the country.
On Sunday evening, in a radio and television message, President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré promised to strengthen the operational capacity of troops on the ground.
About 300 British troops have arrived in the troubled West African state of Mali at a time when the epicentre of the Islamic State group (IS) appears to have moved from the Middle East to Africa.
In a three-year mission named Operation Newcombe they are joining a force of around 15,000 UN multinational troops, spearheaded by the French, in efforts to help stabilise a part of the continent known as the Sahel.
Mali is one of several Sahel nations currently fighting jihadist insurgencies and the violence is getting worse.
According to the Global Terrorism Index published on 25 November, the "centre of gravity" for the Islamic State group IS has moved away from the Middle East to Africa and to some extent South Asia, with total deaths by IS in sub-Saharan Africa up by 67% over last year.
"The expansion of ISIS affiliates into sub-Saharan Africa led to a surge in terrorism in many countries in the region," reports the Global Terrorism Index.
"Seven of the 10 countries with the largest increase in terrorism were in sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso, Mozambique, DRC, Mali, Niger, Cameroon and Ethiopia".
The report points out that in 2019 "sub-Saharan Africa recorded the largest number of ISIS-related terrorism deaths at 982, or 41 per cent of the total".
Jihadists have long been active in Africa.
In modern times the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden made Sudan his base before moving back to Afghanistan in 1996.
Nigeria's Boko Haram movement, infamous for kidnapping hundreds of schoolgirls at Chibok in 2014, carried out major attacks after declaring a jihad in 2010.
But today, as competition increase between rival jihadist groups, the threat of terrorism in the region is increasing.
The US State Department's coordinator for counter-terrorism, ambassador Nathan Sales, says both IS and al-Qaeda have shifted much of their operations away from their heartland in Syria and Iraq to their affiliates in West and East Africa, as well as Afghanistan.
"Africa", he says, "is a key front in the next stage in the fight against terrorism".
But it is not just a case of governments versus insurgents, there is also a deadly rivalry taking place between supporters of al-Qaeda and IS. This rivalry is becoming so intense that French expert on jihad Olivier Guitta from GlobalStrat Risk Consultancy even predicts:
"Africa is going to be the battleground of jihad for the next 20 years and it's going to replace the Middle East".
Al-Qaeda and IS share a common loathing for secular, Western-supported rulers whom they call "apostates".
But they also have major differences in their approach.
IS has a predilection for extreme, graphic, violence - as demonstrated by its gruesome beheading videos.
While this certainly attracts sociopaths and convicted criminals to its ranks, it also tends to repel the vast majority of Muslims.
Al-Qaeda and its affiliates often seek to win over the loyalty of local populations who have no confidence in their governments or their police, exploiting regional and ethnic grievances.
Several of the world's poorest nations border the Sahara desert.
This region is known as "the Sahel", an Arabic word literally meaning "the coast".
Mali, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania make up the Sahel countries and all have suffered attacks from insurgents.
Parts of the region are afflicted variously with drought, poverty, unemployment, corruption and in some cases large tracts of ungoverned space.
"West Africa", says ambassador Sales, "is a perfect storm, with nation states that don't control their territories, commit abuses by their forces, and have porous borders".
The dominant jihadist group in this region is the al-Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat Al-Islam wa'l-Muslimin (JNIM).
The group is in direct competition with the IS affiliate Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and this year has seen a number of low-level battles between them.
Nigeria has suffered some of the worst jihadist attacks in the region, with the government struggling to control the north-east of the country where the Boko Haram movement evolved.
According to the Global Terrorism Index, Boko Haram has been responsible for over "37,500 combat-related deaths and over 19,000 deaths from terrorism since 2011, mainly in Nigeria" but also neighbouring countries.
In 2015, one faction of Boko Haram pledged allegiance to IS, becoming "Islamic State West Africa Province" (Iswap), crossing borders with ease and capturing a multinational base on the shores of Lake Chad in 2018.
IS has since been heavily promoting this African affiliate.
Attacks are still being carried in Boko Haram's name. A video posted by the group on 1 December claimed responsibility for massacring dozens of farmers in Borno state who it claimed had collaborated with government forces.
Western nations have offered only limited military and intelligence assistance to Nigeria. Western diplomats say they are constrained by the corruption and poor human rights record of the Nigerian military.
These failings have been a major contributor towards mistrust of the government and towards recruitment for Boko Haram and other jihadist groups in the region.
"The corruption angle in Nigeria" says Olivier Guitta, "is ruining everything".
Al-Qaeda's insurgency in North Africa started off in Algeria.
So it is no surprise that the newly appointed leader of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) is an Algerian.
The white-bearded 51-year-old Abu Obaida Al-Annabi replaces his predecessor, Abdelmalik Droukdel, who was killed by French troops in Mali in June.
In a microcosm of the wider al-Qaeda-IS rivalry, his appointment has been cheered by al-Qaeda's supporters while rival IS supporters have cast doubt on his jihadist credentials.
Tunisia, the smallest country in the region, produced one of the highest numbers of volunteers - 15-20,000 - who travelled to Syria to join IS during its peak years of 2013-2018.
With high unemployment and a proximity to Libya, Tunisia continues to face an ongoing threat from terrorism.
Libya has been in a state of intermittent chaos ever since the Arab Spring revolt of 2011 and the overthrow of the despotic regime of Muammar Gaddafi.
The end of his regime not only released thousands of tonnes of weapons and explosives from government armouries, much of it making its way across the southern border into the Sahel countries, it also allowed IS jihadists to gain a foothold in the east of Libya.
Somalia's al-Shabab group - Arabic for "the young men" - has been one of the most persistent and dangerous jihadist movements on the entire continent.
"Al-Shabab" says Nathan Sales, "sees itself as al-Qaeda's most successful group"
It has survived concerted multinational military campaigns to eradicate it yet it has been able to strike across its borders in Kenya and Uganda as well as detonating massive bombs in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
US Special Operations raids and drone strikes, launched from neighbouring Djibouti, frequently kill al-Shabab leaders and yet the group has been able to keep regenerating itself.
It has also succeeded in beating back a challenge from the local IS affiliate which is now largely confined to the north-east tip of the Horn of Africa.
The foothold gained by IS in the northern district of Cabo Delgado under the banner of "Islamic State Central Africa Province" (ISCAP), could well be an example of a full-blown insurgency arranged almost entirely over the internet.
Counter-terrorism officials believe that the jihadists operating in this gas-rich part of Mozambique have been recruited online with some input from across the border in Tanzania but largely without the physical presence of recruiters sent from the IS heartlands of Syria and Iraq.
There are conflicting reports as to the veracity of some of the recent atrocities carried out in the name of IS in Cabo Delgado, such as the alleged massacre of around 50 villagers on a football field.
But IS does appear to be getting the upper hand against the government.
"IS" says Olivier Guitta, "is moving around within Mozambique unhampered by other forces".
This is a hugely contentious issue.
In June 2013 all seven leaders at the G7 summit at Loch Erne signed up to an agreement not to pay ransoms to proscribed terrorist organisations.
Seven years on and the reality remains that European citizens tend to be eventually released for undisclosed amounts while British and American hostages are the most likely to get executed.
Several French citizens have been released from jihadist captivity in the Sahel, most recently in exchange for the release of a large number of dangerous jihadist prisoners in Mali.
Analysts have put the total amount paid to jihadist kidnappers in North and West Africa over the years at more than €100m ($120m; £90m).
This ransom money is then used by the jihadists to buy more weapons, more explosives, better vehicles, night vision goggles, communications equipment as well as funding their recruitment efforts and providing bribes to corrupt officials.
Recent attacks on churches in northern Burkina Faso are likely to be the work of jihadists whose activities are growing in the region despite a military operation to contain Islamist militancy.
The country's foreign minister says tackling terrorism has become a fight "for the very survival" of the Sahel region, which incorporates Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.
The militants have forced 100,000 in Burkina Faso alone to flee their homes in recent months.
In the last month there have been at least five attacks targeting Christians, several taking place during church services - though no group has said it was behind these assaults, analysts say they have all the jihadists' hallmarks.
It shows a shift in tactics, according to Djallil Lounnas, an expert on militancy in the Sahara at Morocco's Al Akhawayn University.
"Usually religious minorities have not been touched, especially Christian minorities, since jihadist violence broke out in the area," he says.
This is particularly troubling given Burkina Faso's long history of religious tolerance, but it forms part of a jihadist strategy to sow religious and inter-communal conflict.
"It's an old guerrilla, terrorist tactic to increase their ranks by fuelling mass violence," says Louis Audet-Gosselin of the Canadian Network for Research on Terrorism.
Conflict and instability also create the conditions that allow jihadists to install bases and control territory.
"The security situation in the country is degrading almost daily," says Mr Audet-Gosselin. "Jihadist groups are gaining ground bit by bit, forcing state officials and state sovereignty out of several rural areas and increasingly some cities."
Those targeted are often associated with the state - village counsellors, mayors, police officers, civil servants and civilians accused of collaborating with military.
Schools and teachers are soft targets for Islamists militants, who oppose secular education. More than 1,000 schools in the north have been forced to close recently, affecting more than 150,000 children.
Human Rights Watch has also reported numerous abuses by government forces during counter-terrorism operations, including summary executions of Fulanis, a largely Muslim ethnic group of semi-nomadic herders.
"The army is pretty brutal and tends to single out the Fulani community as a whole, as guilty by association to jihadist groups... which in turn leads to increasing militancy from Fulani youth," says Mr Audet-Gosselin.
A lack of services has created a vacuum that militant groups have been able to exploit by sometimes stepping in to deliver them, but mostly their presence means chaos and violence.
A resident in the northern town of Djibo told the BBC: "Many homes have been deserted. Economic activity has ground to a halt. 
We no longer have any nightlife. 
Westerners who are high-value targets have left."
Witnesses say gunmen also sporadically go on the rampage, looting shops and mugging people.
"Burkina Faso is a barrier between the Sahel and the coastal countries in the fight against terrorism. 
If that is broken down, its neighbours will be affected," warns Burkina Faso's Foreign Minister Alpha Barry.
In April when jihadist leader Oumarou Diallo, who operated in eastern Burkina Faso, was arrested along with some 20 followers, security sources told the BBC they had found evidence he was in contact with people in Togo, Benin and Ghana.
The most high-profile example that this insecurity is already spilling over is the abduction of French tourists from a national park in northern Benin in May.
When French special forces officers secured their release, the kidnappers had already moved them to northern Burkina Faso - and it is believed they were planning to hand them over to Mali-based militants.
French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said at the time that there were two main militant groups operating near where the French tourists were taken - one linked to al-Qaeda and the other to IS.
Le Monde newspaper has also reported an unnamed source as saying armed groups have established themselves in northern Togo and Benin in "hard-to-reach forest areas, where traffickers and bandits in the region are rampant".
Correspondents say many recruits join up, not out of ideology, but simply because they see it as the only alternative to destitution.
But the concern for the government is the belief by intelligence officials that some ex-soldiers of the presidential elite regiment, the RSP, have been lending Ansarul Islam a hand.
The RSP was a unit set up by former President Blaise Compaoré for his personal security, however when he was ousted in an uprising in 2014, it suddenly felt its existence threatened.
In a bid for survival, members staged a short-lived coup against the transitional government before being forced to hand over power by neighbouring countries.
Fleeing justice afterwards, many RSP members, including an officer called Boubacar Sawadogo, took to a clandestine life.
Officials were quoted by a Malian newspaper in 2017 as saying that they had intercepted a communication between Mr Sawadogo and Ansarul Islam's leader.
The intercept confirmed what the government had long suspected - that former RSP members were taking part in attacks by jihadists both in Mali and Burkina Faso.
A state of emergency was declared in several regions in December, granting security forces extra powers to search homes and restrict freedom of movement.
According to the UN, more than a fifth of the country's national budget is spent on defence and security.
But the former French colony, a poor country even by West African standards, is struggling and the security forces remain ill-equipped to tackle the scale of the jihadist threat.
It is part of a five-national regional force, the G5 Sahel, created in September 2017 to take on the militants.
Yet most of the funds pledged by partners and donors - including the European Union - still have not been handed over, says the BBC's Simon Gongo in Burkina Faso.
"Reconstruction of an effective security apparatus with a competent intelligence branch and elite commandos will take time, as will improving the G5's operational readiness," says International Crisis Group in its latest report on Burkina Faso.
France also has some 4,500 troops in the Sahel region in an ongoing counter-terror mission codenamed Operation Barkhane.
Fuel prices at the pumps have been reduced by 8 pesewas per litre effective Wednesday, May 5, 2021.
This means that the recent 17 pesewas per litre increase announced by the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) has been reduced to 9 pesewas per litre.
It takes effect from Wednesday, May 5, 2021.
This was made known in a communique issued on Tuesday, May 4, 2021 by the stakeholders in the fuel sector at a meeting held at the Ministry of Energy between the Minister of Energy, Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh and the National Petroleum Authority (NPA), the Association of Oil Marketing Companies (AOMCs), Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation Co Ltd (BOST), the Chamber of Petroleum Consumers (COPEC) and the Institute for Energy Policies and Research (INSTEPR).
"The 17 pesewas per litre increase in fuel margins previously announced by the NPA has been reduced to 9 pesewas per litre effective tomorrow Wednesday 5th May 2021," the communique said.
The communique was signed by the Minister of Energy, NPA, BOST, AOMCs. COPEC and INSTEPR.
The development followed a request by the Minister of Energy for a round table discussion to revise certain components on the price build up.
In justifying the fuel price increment, the Public Relations Officer of the National Petroleum Authority (NPA), Yaro Kasambata has explained that the level of fuel consumption in the country is a contributor to the cause of the fuel price hike.
According to him, the country’s fuel consumption level over the last 10 years indicates that Ghana is growing with a lot of cars on the road and is full of economic activities to match the demand of fuel to do things in the country.
Speaking on Okay Fm’s "Ade Akye Abia" Morning Show, Yaro Kasambata revealed that with petrol only, Ghanaians consume 120 million litres every month while diesel consumption is 160 million litres monthly.
He maintained that with these amounts of fuel consumption monthly, it results in even 1 Pesewa increase in the fuel price accumulating huge sums of money; emphasizing that “the high level of fuel consumption is making it difficult to maintain fuel price due to how we have grown. As we are today, we were not the same in 10 years ago”.
He however outlined three factors as the main cause of the fuel price increases, naming one cause to be the price of crude oil and the price of the world market refined petrol. 
He added that between mid Februarys to May 17, prices of crude oil and refined product on the world market have gone up.
He mentioned that crude oil only went up by 34 percent, petrol by 37 percent, diesel went up by 36 percent and with LPG, it went up by 43 percent; slating that with these increases, Ghana cannot maintain or reduce fuel prices.
With the second cause of fuel price increase, Yaro Kasambata blames it on the depreciation of the cedi against the dollar, indicating that between mid Februarys and now, the cedi has depreciated against the dollar as this has affected the price of fuel.
He mentioned thirdly that the policy of full cost recovery to make the price of crude oil in the world market to match the price of Ghana is another to factor which has contributed to the fuel price increases.
He bemoaned that as the NPA maintained the fuel price between the mid February to May 17, there has been a debt of Gh¢146 million and so without these increases in fuel price the authority cannot get letters of credit to buy fuel and as such there will be a shortage in the country.
Commenting on the current price of crude oil in the world market, Yaro Kasambata revealed it is $64.32 dollars per barrel. 
He however failed to comment on whether the current price of crude in comparison with Kufuor’s era where it was sold for $147 per barrel merit the current fuel price with the excuse that he is not a politician.
The Government has commiserated with the families of the three persons who perished in the Monday accident at Onyinanumfo in the Ahafo-Ano South-West District of the Ashanti Region.
“We are deeply saddened by what has befallen this community, and would continue to stand solidly behind all those affected in the calamity,” Mr. Eric Nana Agyemang-Prempeh, Director-General of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), told the media.
This was when he visited the affected community with other NADMO officials to assess the extent of damage caused to the farming community, following the accident on May 24.
The three, including a two-year-old boy, perished when a speeding fuel tanker, reportedly carrying diesel from Kumasi, caught fire after hitting a parked commercial bus on reaching a sharp curve in that community.
The fuel was to be discharged at Tepa.
Five passengers on the bus who got injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, while the bodies of the deceased have also been deposited at the morgue for autopsy.
More than 100 persons, who lost their homes in the inferno, are putting up in make-shift structures.
Mr. Agyemang-Prempeh, therefore, presented some relief items to the victims.
They include 20 packets of roofing sheets, 50 mattresses,100 pieces of blankets, mosquito nets and insecticide.
He also presented 20 bags of cooking oil, soap and quantities of second-hand clothing to them.
The NADMO Director-General described the incident as unfortunate and prayed for the souls of the departed.
Fuel prices have gone up by an average of 19.4% this year, driven by depreciation of the cedi and rising prices of crude oil, as well as prices of finished petroleum products on the world market.
Last year ended with a litre of petrol selling at an average price of GH¢3.79 while the average price of diesel was GH¢3.75
The average price of crude oil in 2016 was $55 per barrel.
Speaking to The Finder, the Principal Research Analyst of the Institute for Energy Security (IES), Richmond Rockson, said that for 2017, crude oil traded for $63 per barrel as of December, which is one of the highest since June 2015.
19.4% fuel price increase in 2017
He explained that the current average price of a litre of petrol and diesel is GH¢4.49, and this represents an average increase of 19.4% compared to the 2016 figures.
Gallon of fuel costs GH¢20.20 
According to him, currently, a gallon of petrol and diesel costs GH¢20.20, compared to GH¢17.05 per a gallon in 2016. 
He noted that the increases were mainly fuelled by exchange rate depreciation, prices of finished products, and rising crude oil prices.
Breakdown of pricing mechanism
Rockson explained that in calculating fuel prices, crude oil constitutes 20% of the pricing mechanism, exchange rate makes up 30% of pricing, and the finished product constitutes 50% of the pricing.
The Principal Research Analyst of IES noted that the cedi ended 2016 at GH¢4 to $1, but 15% depreciation in 2017 has moved the exchange rate to GH¢4.62 to $1.
7 Pesewas PSRL reduction on diesel and LPG
Government recently reduced the Price Stabilisation and Recovery Levy (PSRL) on diesel by seven pesewas per litre from the current 10 pesewas to three pesewas. 
In the same vein, the PSRL on LPG was reduced by seven pesewas per kilogramme from 10 pesewas to three pesewas.
2.5% drop in Special Petroleum Levy in 2017
The government, in its 2017 budget, reduced the Special Petroleum Tax from 17.5% to 15%, and went ahead to scrap the excise duty on petroleum products.
Without these interventions, Ghanaians would have been paying more for fuel than the current fuel prices.
Data from IES in the 24 pricing windows in 2017 has been analysed.

The Minister for Works and Housing, Francis Asenso-Boakye, says the Takoradi Market Circle drainage system reconstruction work, has been captured in the Ministry’s 2021 flood control program.
Francis Asenso-Boakye, while on a two-day tour of the Western Region, gave the assurance after inspecting the main drainage system at Essikafoambatem Number Two, which has been found to be the cause of regular flooding within the Takoradi Market Circle area.
“The Western Regional Minister has been talking to me about the flooding situation around the Takoradi Market Circle area. 
So I took advantage of my tour of the region to come and have a first-hand look at the major problem here. Prior to this, officials of the Hydrological Service Department came here to assess the situation and I can say that it is part of the Ministry’s 2021 Flood Control Program which we are currently in talks with the Finance Ministry for the needed funds to come and start fixing the problem here. 
We are very hopeful that we will get the resources from the Finance Ministry and once we are able to solve the problem at this side of the drainage channel, the issue of flooding around the market would be reduced“, he said.
The Western Regional Minister, Kwabena Okyere Darko Mensah, who toured the sewage system with the Works and Housing Minister, said the fixing of the sewage system would bring a lot of relief to residents of Takoradi
The Minister for Works and Housing also visited two sea defense projects at Aboadze and Amanfokuma, and expressed satisfaction with the quality of work executed by the contractors. He said the two projects are key to the fishing industry and the coastal communities’ existence.
“ I must say that so far I’m impressed with the quality of work done by the contractors. 
The visit has given me the opportunity to see at first hand the progress of work, comparing it with the reports I had received in the office. 
It has also given me the chance to interact with the stakeholders including the communities. Key among them is the fisherfolk who are the direct beneficiaries of these projects. 
The sea defense project has many benefits including protection of lives, property, and livelihoods especially fishing activities which is the mainstay of the economy of the coastal communities. 
The visit has exposed me to some variations that I will go back to the office to discuss and redesign with the consultant to accommodate the needed variations”, he said.
Francis Asenso-Boakye, who was accompanied on his first-day tour of the Western Region by the Managing Director of the State Housing Corporation, Kobina Ampoful Appiah, also visited the State Housing developments at Ituma in the Shama District, as well as some dilapidated Police Quarters at Effiakuma.
The Works and Housing Minister is expecting to finish his tour-day of the Western Region with the inspection of the Axim and Dixcove sea defense projects in the Nzema East Municipality and Ahanta West District respectively.
The Mayor of Accra, Mohammed Adjei Sowah, says the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) is preparing for the coming rains to avoid a recurrence of flooding within the city.
His assurance comes on the back of the caution by the Ghana Meteorological Agency indicating that the country is set to experience rains in most areas, accompanied by strong winds this year.
The Mayor, in an interview with Citi News, said the necessary precautionary measures are being put in place.
According to him, most of the storm drains are being desilted by the various assemblies in Accra.
“Generally, we are also looking at preparations towards the rains because Accra is typically lying on low land, so anytime it rains heavily, the downflow of the water gets to Accra, and then, unfortunately, we also experience tidal waves which also blocks the water from entering the sea. 
Currently, the Korle lagoon is being dredged by Dreg Masters, with funding from the Ministry of Works and Housing, and the storm drains in Accra are also being desilted by the various assemblies.”
“So in terms of preparations on the water bodies, we are far in advance in making sure that the perennial flooding mostly experienced in Accra will be a thing of the past.”
The Mayor also indicated that the AMA will continue to demolish structures built on waterways, and further cautioned persons who throw solid waste into water bodies to desist from such actions.
According to him, these are the only measures by which the issue of perennial flooding can be curtailed.
“We should also be mindful that climate change has also induced and changed the rainfall pattern. 
The other side is also that people that have built on the waterways. We will continue to pull down those structures but most importantly people who throw solid waste into our drains must also stop.”
The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, has tasked the Works and Housing Ministry to take steps to address perennial flooding in parts of the country.
The Asantehene expressed concern about the indiscriminate dumping of waste into drains and construction on waterways, which he cited as major causes of flooding.
He said this when the Works and Housing Minister, Francis Asenso-Boakye, paid a courtesy call on him at the Manhyia Palace during a working visit to the Ashanti Region.
Indiscriminate dumping of waste into open drains and the siting of buildings on waterways have often been cited as some of the major causes of perennial flooding in parts of the country.
Some areas within the Kumasi Metropolis and parts of the Ashanti and Greater Accra Regions have been experiencing flooding for many years.
Although there have been some interventions by government to address this situation, human behaviour in some cases is said to be impeding the efforts.
The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, wants the Works and Housing Ministry to work towards addressing flooding in the country.
“Whenever there is a downpour, there is flooding because the drains are choked. 
Some people dump indiscriminately into the drains and the water is not able to flow freely. 
It was in the era of Busia that he initiated the construction of sewage systems, but that has not been continued by successive governments. 
If we don’t find a permanent solution to the flooding situation, the roads we construct will continue to deteriorate. People have also built on waterways, and this is blocking the water and causing flooding. 
When the flooding happens it is the government that is blamed. People dump into the drains, and they have to be checked. 
The Minister has been given this task and I believe he can execute it. 
Work with all the relevant authorities to address the situation. 
I know with your good upbringing you will be able to make it”, he said.
The Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA) has identified about 400 structures that have been built on waterways and is taking steps to demolish them.
Asenso-Boakye inspected some drainage projects in the Ashanti Region and called for a concerted effort to tackle flooding.
“Government has in the last four years invested so much in drainage works, but this is not something government alone can do. 
We saw the waste material that was deposited at Atafoa by the Owabi River. 
It means that people are indiscriminately throwing waste into drains and that is not the way to go. 
I have said many times that if this issue of flooding is going to be addressed, then we must see it as a collective responsibility”, he urged.
The Minister also mentioned that a flood control programme is being developed to help address the recurring situation.
The Leadership of the Kejetia Market Association has given management and Board of Directors of the new Kejetia market a two-week ultimatum to address some challenges faced by traders in the market.
According to the traders, since occupying the market spaces early 2020, they have been charged exorbitant electricity bills without any justification.
The traders also complained that although they are barely a year at the market, their biggest fear since occupying the shops has been flooding which may destroy their shops and their goods.
The Public Relations Officer for the Kejetia Traders Association, Andrews Kwofie who spoke at a news conference in Kumasi described the situation as unacceptable.
He called on the management of the market to ensure that all concerns are addressed within the next two weeks.
“Why will an edifice like this with this huge investment have leakages whenever it rains. 
We are telling management to immediately come to the aid of traders. 
There is always flooding when it rains here. 
We will consider a very drastic action if our concerns are not addressed.”
Some of these traders were selling on pavements and streets within the Central Business District (CBD) in the metropolis until they were asked to relocate to the Kejetia Market.
The directive was opposed by several traders who had raised concerns about exorbitant charges for the relocation.
However, the Chief Executive Officer for the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA),  Osei Assibey Antwi insisted on the relocation, arguing that the decision was not a unilateral one.
The public has been cautioned to avoid walking or driving through flood waters as the rainy season peaks in Southern Ghana.
“Sometimes, a stretch of running water might seem easy to wade or swim through, but strong currents could easily sweep you off and carry you away when you attempt to swim or wade your way through.”
Mr Richard Amo-Yartey, Director for Inspectorate at the Headquarters of the National Disaster Management (NADMO), in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, also cautioned motorists against driving through flood waters, adding that many cars were swept away because drivers had underestimated the strong currents within seemingly harmless flood waters.
He said flood waters, even if one could safely swim or wade through them, also often carried dangerous objects such as faecal matter and other forms of disease-causing material and dangerous reptiles that could easily harm a human.
“It is often a much better option to be patient and wait for flood waters to recede than to risk harm that could easily be avoided,” said Mr. Amo-Yartey.
He also cautioned people staying within places that are prone to flooding and urged them to relocate to safer places to avoid the inconveniences of flooding during the rainy season.
Mr Amo-Yartey reminded the public that while the government was always working around the clock to ensure the welfare of people, individuals had the responsibility of ensuring their safety.
“The rains are here with us. 
People should be alert and stay wary of the dangers of the season, to remain safe,” he said.
Mr Amo-Yartey said NADMO was educating communities on how to stay safe in the face of floods and other ill effects of the rainy season.
He urged people in emergency situations to call the hotlines of NADMO, which are 112 or 0299350030.
Meanwhile, the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) has urged the public to read its daily and weekly forecast on the website to plan their activities.
A four-hour downpour last Saturday caused flooding in many parts of Southern Ghana, including Kasoa, Weija, Adentan and many others.
Many people had to wait for some hours before they could leave or return to their homes, because of heavy flooding.
Several communities in the Nanumba South District of the Northern Region continue to suffer as floods continue to wreak havoc in homes and farms.
Some residents living close to the Oti river are counting their losses following heavy rains on Sunday, October 11, 2020, that got the several communities flooded.
Roads have been cut off making it difficult for people to access the district capital for basic needs.
The communities include Chichagi, Lahato, Egambo, Mualaa, all in the Nanumba South District.
Buildings have collapsed, farms submerged and bridges washed off.
The people say they have no place to lay their heads and are calling on the authorities to come to their aid.
“All our belongings have been submerged in the floods, I have nowhere to go. 
What to eat is even a problem. 
We need the government to support us. All my belongings are gone,” a victim said.
“All my properties are gone. 
All I have left are the clothes I have on. 
I am begging the government to help put up our structures again,” another victim shared
The District National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO) Coordinator, Yaw Kojo Kumah Edward also appealed for support for the victims.
“Several buildings have collapsed. We can no longer identify the areas. 
We have about 157 people identified, and we are still counting. 
We are appealing to the government, religious bodies, and the NGOs to come to our aid. 
Most of these people have no one to look up to. 
They survive majorly on farming, and as their farms have been submerged in the floods, they have nothing to feed on.”
The Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), West Mamprusi in the North East Region, Aremeyaw Somo Lucky, says the GHS100,000 presented by the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia in support of flood victims has been disbursed.
Dr. Bawumia offered the money with an assurance that the government will assist in rebuilding the houses for the displaced victims in the area.
Villages were submerged in floodwaters following the massive torrential rains that forced the banks of three dams to break, allowing the water from the dams to rush onto the villages.
Acres of farmlands were submerged while some livestock were carried away by the floodwaters, a situation that led to the donation from Dr. Bawumia to enable the affected victims to get some relief items.
The Director-General of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), Eric Nana Agyemang-Prempeh, has explained that the perennial spillage of the Bagre Dam in Burkina is a contributory factor to the recent flooding in parts Accra.
A downpour over the weekend left many parts of Accra, including Weija and its adjoining communities flooded, restricting movement and causing damage to property.
“Previously, the spillage from the Bagre Dam was flowing at 4-8million gallons per minute, but now it’s flowing 29 million gallons per minute at a very tough speed to Ghana, therefore almost all the rivers in the country are full, so the little rainfall, then it floods everywhere”
The NADMO Director General said this during a visit to some flood prone areas in the Greater Accra Region.
According to NADMO, this year, it collaborated with Municipal and District Assemblies to dredge several drains in anticipation of the rains, but the rivers could not absorb the overflow from the Bagre Dam.
Mr. Agyemang Prempeh advised those who take advantage of the rain to throw to dump rubbish into already choked drains, to put a stop to the practice; as it contributes to the flooding in Accra.
The NADMO Director General, together with the Greater Accra Regional Director, Archibold Cobbina, MP for Weija-Gbawe, Tina Naa Ayeley Mensah, and MP for Bortianor Ngleshie Amanfrom, Sylvester Tetteh, visited some victims in some of the flood prone areas at Weija- Gbawe and Bortianor Ngleshie Amanfrom.
They sympathized with the affected victims and promised to assist them with some relief items.
The Municipal Chief Executive for West Mamprusi Assembly in the North East Region, Issahaku Aremeyaw Somo, has said he escaped a robbery attack on Monday, October 12, 2020.
This happened when the MCE was travelling to communities to disburse money to victims of recent flooding in the region.
Speaking on Eyewitness News, Mr. Somo said he was able to escape the attack because security personnel came in time to open fire on a group of robbers who attempted to block his convoy.
“Fortunately the police came in. But then at the time, they had already shot a motor rider on the leg. 
I was with the chiefs distributing the money when they brought him. 
They quickly rushed him to the hospital. 
I was alarmed, so I quickly had to go back to Walewale.”
“That particular road is noted for robbery. Because of that, we mounted a number of security checks in the area and that had helped in curbing the attacks. 
But recently, the police had an accident in the area, and so they had toned down a bit, so I am sure these robbers wanted to take advantage of the situation. 
But luck evaded them,” he added.
On Thursday, October 1, 2020, four villages, Gaagbini, Dimia, Tinkaya, and Banawa were submerged in floodwaters following massive torrential rains that forced the banks of three dams to break, allowing the water from the dams to rush onto the villages.
The government gave GHS100,000 to the MCE to support flood victims in the municipality. 
Mr. Somo said he suspects the robbers may have come after the money in his possession.
“We are suspecting they came after the GHS100,000. Since then, I have had to move about with security. 
That way, my security is assured while disbursing the money.”
The Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) has begun spilling excess water from the Weija Dam.
This is due to the downpour in the catchment area of the Densu River basin.
It began the spillage on Sunday, October 11, 2020.
“The safe operating level of the Weija Dam is 47ft, however, the heavy rains shot the dam level from 46.8ft to 48.4ft in less than 24 hours, prompting the spillage immediately to prevent it from possible collapse,” the GWCL explained in a statement.
It thus said it has informed the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), the National Security, Bureau of National Investigation (BNI), Chiefs, District Assembly, opinion leaders and all stakeholders downstream the dam “to evacuate the area immediately to avoid any eventuality.”
The affected communities include Tetegu, Oblogo, Pambros Salt, Lower McCarthy Hill, Lower Weija, Bojo Beach, Ada Kopey and surrounding communities.
The company is expecting more rain in the area and has said it, along with NADMO and other sector agencies, “are making arrangement for the provision of water and other services to the people displaced by the flood.”
Residents of Weija had to contend with flooding this past weekend due to a downpour.
They have been appealing for storm drains to help with the drainage of run-off water.
Victims of flooding in the West Mamprusi municipality are still crying out for help from the state after being displaced.
A day after the government donated GHS100,000 and relief items to floods victims of Thursday torrential rain in parts of the West Mamprusi municipality, the flood victims are yet to receive improved help.
Speaking to Citi News, some displaced persons complained about hunger as food meant for the victims from the assembly are not forthcoming.
A victim of the flooding complained about the conditions in the schools being used as havens saying, “for the past three days, we have been finding it difficult to fend for ourselves.”
“We have only been provided with two classrooms to live in. 
We are over 300, but because of the limited space, we the men have left the classrooms for the women and children while we hang around outside. The food is not enough, they brought in 77 food packs whereas we are close to 300 in number.”
“We do not know what to do now, the DCE allowed us to move in here until further notice. 
The food they provide is not enough, we are forced to hand them over to the children while we strive to survive. 
They claim they have brought us food, but we are not feeling the impact. We have nothing to survive on, with no helper,” another lamented.
“The said amount donated to us by the government has not been disbursed yet, the DCE and NPP parliamentary candidate took the money to Walewale but we have not heard from them,” he added.
Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia cut short his campaign tour of the Greater Accra Region to visit the victims of the devastating floods.
Upon arrival, he donated GHS 100,000 to food victims.
Four villages; Gaagbini, Dimia, Tinkaya and Banawa have been the hardest hit in the municipality.
On Thursday, the villages were submerged in floodwaters following massive torrential rains that forced the banks of three dams to break, allowing the water from the dams to rush onto the villages.
Acres of farmlands were submerged while some livestock was carried away by the floodwaters.
A herdsman has been arrested in Tamale in the Northern Region for allegedly swindling the Tamale District Police Commander, Chief Superintendent, Iddrisu Tanko Issifu.
In his quest to become a cattle farmer, Chief Superintendent Tanko Issifu, last year, allegedly entered into a barter agreement with two herdsmen– Osman Mumuni and Seidu Braimah– who promised to sell to him cattle.
According to a police statement, the two herdsmen initially took a sum of GHS36,100.00 to supply the police chief with 53 cattle.
The two later entered into an agreement to buy his Toyota Scion with registration number GW 7-Z in exchange for 40 cattle.
After that, they again allegedly took Chief Superintendent Tanko Issifu’s Land Cruiser Prado with Registration number GS 5939-11 with his consent to supply additional 300 cattle.
According to the police statement, the district commander also gave the suspects another GHS56,000.00 to buy 70 more cattle.
The statement further indicated that, as part of their agreement, the suspects were to take care of the cattle, which numbered about 556.
However, the District Police Commander in an attempt to inspect the animals yielded no result as the herdsmen allegedly kept giving him excuses.
“When he later tried to check up on the suspects and the animals numbering about 556 cattle and 40 calves, they told him the cattle had been sent to a far distance for grazing but failed to show the whereabouts of the animals,” the statement noted.
“He went to the location of the suspects to inspect the animals, but to his disappointment no human being was found, let alone cattle.”
According to the statement, the police chief was alarmed and caused the arrest of one of the suspects while efforts are underway to apprehend the second suspect, Seidu Braimah, who is currently on the run.
The Regional Coordinating Director for Ahafo Region, Ebenezer Amoah has admonished youth in the region to desist from shying away from informal sector jobs and take advantage of such avenues to boost their economic lives.
Youth groups across the region on Wednesday, June 30 met the leadership of the region at the Regional Coordinating Council to present to them developmental challenges they face.
Krontihene for Ntotroso Traditional area, Nana Akofo Amankonah I, addressing the issues also challenged the youth to make career choices that will help them to be innovative in order to meet the diverse available target markets.
“If you’re a tailor, you can decide to master producing only boxer shorts and prosper, same as vulcanizers. One can choose to master and work on just truck tyres or tyres of small cars”, he said.
The National Youth Authority (NYA) in collaboration with ActionAid has been organizing workshops throughout the region for youth groups to deliberate on the issues confronting youth development.
ActionAid Ghana through the implementation of its three years project; Promoting Employment Opportunities for Young people in Ghana (PEOY) is empowering young people with skills and knowledge in livelihood activities and encouraging their participation in decision-making that affects their lives.
These workshops sought to establish linkages between PEOY beneficiaries, Youth Parliament members, Young Women Movement, Activists and give them a bigger voice and enable them to grow into a movement for youth advocacy in the region.
Amongst key issues presented and discussed were youth unemployment, substance abuse, teenage pregnancy, and terrible road networks.
According to KPMG Global Mining Institute, Ghana presents several opportunities in the mining sector, especially in the gold industry. Statistically, it is proven that Gold represents Ghana’s major export commodity, providing, 50% of GDP, (Ministry of Land and Natural Resources (MLNR), 2003).
Ghana is also the second-largest gold producer in Africa, after South Africa and the 10th largest globally with Peru being the sixth largest producer. 
The other important mineral resources are oil, diamond, bauxite and magnesium.
Mining has become a controversial business everywhere. 
The continuous debate of the mining business is due to its great economical contribution to the country. 
Within the past few decades, Ghana’s mining sector specifically the small-scale mining sector has been defaced with arguments mainly as a result of its threats to sustainable development. 
Small scale mining in Ghana generally refers to artisanal mining of precious minerals particularly gold and diamond. Artisanal and Small-scale mining is a practice that involves rudimentary techniques of mineral extraction, highly manual processes, hazardous working conditions, and frequently affecting the human and environmental bodies negatively.
In Ghana, it is estimated that two to three million people are engaged in this activity; about 170,000 are directly or indirectly into illegal mining (galamsey) as they solely depend on it for their livelihoods.
The term ‘galamsey’ is a local dialect, coined from the statement, “Gather and Sell” as it explains what these workers do. 
This activity is flagged as a lucrative venture and a quickest way of earning an income which makes local Ghanaians, particularly the youth the active participant in this sector. 
Illegal mining seeks to be the only alternative of alleviating poverty to the people involved but in two folds perpetuates poverty through high sensitivity to physical hazards, illness, accidents, and lack of knowledge about more efficient, safer, and environmentally friendly techniques.
In recent cases, there has been a season of tragedy as it has been recorded that people involved in this activity lost their lives as a result of being trapped when a pit collapses or a landslide occurs and affect the water bodies. 
On Wednesday, November 11, 2009, an estimated 30 illegal miners lost their lives as a result of landslides at Dopoase in the Wassa Amenfi East District of the Western region where 14 out of the 18 retrieved corpses were women.
Similarly, there was another tragedy at Dunkwa-On-Offin in 2010 in the Central Region where several miners were trapped in a pit when it caved on them near the Offin river resulting in the death of 100 miners. The inception of this activity is not affiliated with a single body or organization. Citizens are equally to be criticized. 
It is known that this activity takes place under cover of darkness or hidden places such as forests, existing farms, river beds, valley and remote areas aided by foreigners especially the Chinese.
Since 2000, about 50,000 Chinese gold miners have migrated to Ghana to engage in small-scale mining.
The rapid relocation of these foreigners was mainly driven by the high demand for gold prices, increasing cultural corporation between China and Ghana and the largely informal nature of the illegal mining. 
The remodel traditional method of using pickaxe, shovel and pan to new technology such as the use of excavators cause environmental threats and social conflicts where the indigenes attacked the armed Chinese miners. Consequently, there is a proven climatic and social change due to the nature of the work, bad weather conditions, and degradation of natural resources which disturbs human survival in these artisanal environments. 
The primitive techniques of these miners which are illegal and unregulated contaminate the water as a result of the discharged sewage which contains toxic chemicals such as cyanide and other organic chemicals used in the processing of mineral ores. These chemicals together result in waste with high acid levels which either seep into underground water or flow into the environment posing danger to the people.
The unchanged attitudinal behaviour of the political actors, law enforcement bodies, local chiefs and farmers towards the practice of illegal mining make this activity thrive. The law enforcement body provides these foreigners with guns to defend themselves from locals on the grounds of generating a beneficial budget for the police and immigration authorities. 
There is also a lack of political will to combat this activity which is evidently because these politicians also benefit from these activities; the political leaders send threats to the appointed leaders of the task force to release the seized excavators or lose their jobs which derails the nation’s fight against galamsey.
Chiefs and landowners of these mining areas are rendered powerless when the foreigners proceed to work on their lands with a granted permission from the lawmakers in the state. 
In a quest to fight this activity, in May 2013, former President, John Mahama set up an inter-ministerial task force to roll out illegal small-scale miners where they were able to deport 4592 Chinese officials by mid-July 2013 but despite their efforts failed to entirely wipe out illegal mining activities. Similarly in August 2017, the task force arrested over 1370 miners including 247 Chinese officials with consequent arrest 33, 15, 7, 24 in April, June, August and September respectively.
Although these actions brought about diplomatic dilemmas to Ghana, President Nana Akufo-Addo on his visit to China in 2019 assured the Chinese officials on how the country remains keen to encourage economic corporation but would not hesitate to persecute China national involved in the illegal mining activity to ease the diplomatic tension between these two countries. 
In a scientific published article by the World Bank titled, Strategy for African Mining, it is estimated that some 30,000 people are employed within the legalized segment of the Ghana small-scale mining sector. Minerals Commission and Ghana Chamber of Mines, also noted that 60 per cent of the country’s mining labour force is, in fact, employed at small-scale mines.
Regional employment assessments have estimated that over 6,000 illegal and 117 registered artisanal gold mines are found in Tarkwa alone. 
Comparatively, the country’s top three major unfamiliar organizations by and large produce over 30% of the country’s gold creation and add to above half of the government incomes. 
It is in this margin both in terms of the output and labour force that the government must formalize galamsey practices as it would represent a critical fiscal boost for the country not disputing the fact on how it is publicly known as a challenge for the government to set policies on how to benefits from the artisanal and small-scale mining while minimizing the negative consequences mining activities.
Similarly in August 2017, the task force arrested over 1370 miners including 247 Chinese officials with consequent arrest 33, 15, 7, 24 in April, June, August and September respectively.

The government must however educate and provide the miners in the rural areas the needed resources in terms of tools for a safer conducive environment and preserve the natural bodies. 
The means of controlling the galamsey activities do not entirely depend on the political actors. 
It must be recognized as a collective effort, from political actors, chiefs, the law enforcement body and the citizenry.
To conclude, this research has addressed a number of significant issues which shows that illegal mining if not harnessed would stall the country’s development and the smooth running of the country.
The 1992 constitution of the Republic of Ghana states that chiefs are the overall custodians of the customary land however, the state own the resources underneath or on the surface of the land. 
It is in this regard that the government must involve the traditional leaders and other stakeholders and be on the same page in relation to the laws and policy making.
The government should employ ways to enlighten and aid the people involved in this activity to improve their standard of living. 
This can be done by educating them on the prices, providing them with well-equipped tools, creating a forum where miners can share their experiences on the financial means of production and processing respectively.
The government can grant university graduates from the mines sector to regulate these activities. 
Mining schools in the country with the authorization of the government can establish a consulting firm where the students and graduates can be recruited as monitoring officials instead of the security officials which also helps reduce unemployment in the state.
The government should register the small scale or galamsey business under a well-structured established corporation with norms and values to uphold which will help regulate and manage this activity to ensure an effective and environmentally friendly mining techniques.
It is quite known and asserted that abolishing galamsey is not the best option for the government. 
The state can, however, curb the problems by enforcing fixed regulations in the various mining codes with regards to environmental restoration. 
For instance, strict rules should be adopted to ensure that miners cover their pits when they finish their operation.
The Municipal Chief Executive for Asante Akyem South, Alexander Frimpong has denied his involvement in illegal mining activities in the area.
The MCE was accused of being complicit in a recent galamsey activity that resulted in the death of one person.
But the MCE in an interview with Citi News denied this claim
“Some persons who were pained and think that I contributed to their defeat are spreading such falsehood.”
The Assembly Member for the area also reiterated that Mr. Frimpong had never been involved in galamsey activities.
Our attention has been drawn to a media release on the subject as indicated above.
The said release is about a collapsed galamsey pit which killed one person at Obroni Junction near Ofoase.The story attributes the galamsey pit as one owned by our Municipal Chief Executive, Hon. Alexander Frimpong and the constituency Youth Organizer, Mr. Simon Agyemang.
We want to state categorically clear that, it is untrue the pit belongs to our Honorable MCE and constituency Youth Organizer. 
It’s another attempt by people who are trying all negative means to destroy the reputation of our hardworking MCE and incite His Excellency the president against him.
We want to repeat here that,our MCE is not a galamseyer,he has never engaged in galamsey activities and he will never engage in acts he is helping the president to fight and eliminate. As indicated in previous press release, Hon. Alexander Frimpong is fighting the galamsey menace in the municipality. His hard work and directives has led to the arrest of 3 galamsey operatives who are currently facing trial at the Juaso Circuit Court.
Our investigations has it that the person behind the twisted story is one particular aspirant in the last NPP constituency parliamentary primaries and his cohorts who are also interested in getting their candidate nominated by the president for the position of MCE.
According to the municipal police commander and the Assembly member for the area,the said mining pit is an old pit of about 20years. 
The Children had gone there in search of gold as they have occasionally been doing and unfortunately the pit collapsed and in the process killed one of them.
A leading member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Sylvester Mensah, has described as lazy and reckless the burning of excavators used for illegal mining in various parts of the country.
He said the excavators can be put to better use, to develop communities and create value for the economy rather than destroy them.
In a Facebook post, the former NHIS head said the current approach smacks of ‘insufficient thinking process’.
The government in a renewed fight against illegal mining across the country especially in forest reserves and on water bodies has deployed hundreds of soldiers to remove illegal miners from different parts of the country.
Reports received so far from the grounds show that as part of the operations of the security officers, they burn excavators and other equipment used in the illegal mining process.
But according to Sylvester Mensah, the government must rethink the approach of burning the excavators.
He said a future NDC government will not burn seized galamsey excavators.
“A future NDC government would not burn seized galamsey excavators. Clearly, it is a lazy and reckless mindset. 
Earthmoving equipment can be put to many other important uses, in many communities in this country,” he said.
“Considering this nauseous Bawumia economy with its self-inflicted epileptic power supply, one would have thought that this government, having dispossessed galamsey owners of their equipment, would put them to alternative uses to develop our communities and generate value for the economy… 
We are witnessing the manifestation of an insufficient thinking process.”
The Minister for Defence, Dominic Nitiwul in a recent press engagement said in this new phase of the military operation, one wooden accommodation facility, ten plastic chairs, 28 excavators, 18 water pumping machines, eight (8) industry batteries, five canoes and 267 Changheng machines had been destroyed.
The rest are 21 new pumping machines, two (2) industry machines, a KIA Truck, two (2) pump action guns were also seized.
The case of the 33 supposed National Security operatives who were arrested for galamsey activities in the Eastern is getting more intense as the Kaneshie District Court refused jurisdiction to hear the case and grant them bail.
Drama unfolded when the court turned down an invitation to grant bail to 11 of the suspects who appeared before it.
The prosecutor, ASP Sylvester Asare, was in court to secure a remand order to enable the state to gather evidence and make its case against the suspects.
A case of possession of firearms without lawful excuse is being built against them.
But the defence lawyers drew Her Worship, Ama Adomako Kwakye’s attention to Section 192 (2) of the Criminal and Offences Act 1960, Act 29 as amended, which requires the Attorney General’s written consent in such matters before the court can entertain it.
Her Worship Adomako Kwakye, on the basis of the provision, declined to hear the case.
She said the consequence of the provision was that there was neither a case of bail nor remand properly before the court to be heard, and subsequently released the suspects.
But as is the situation in such cases, and was to be expected, all 11 suspects were immediately re-arrested.
According to the prosecution, the 33 accused persons presented themselves as operatives of the National Security set up but in fact, are not.
The suspects have been accused of visiting several mining communities in and around the Eastern and Ashanti Regions to undertake illegal mining activities.
They are said to have threatened residents, demanded and seized unspecified kilos of gold and varying sums of money from certain galamsey operators acting in the name of National Security.
The state submitted that security agencies picked intelligence sometime in January that the accused persons armed with rifles were undertaking illegal mining activities in the name of the National Security and harassing communities around the Eastern Region.
And on May 4, 2021, a team of plain-clothed and uniformed personnel from the National Security Secretariat were dispatched to the Akenteng forest reserve, near Osinease in the Eastern Region where they rescued the accused persons from the clutches of angry youth.
This operation the Prosecution said was supported by officers from the Eastern Regional Police Command.
The accused persons were subsequently transported to Accra for interrogations during which they are said to have admitted that they were not National Security Operatives.
They, however, claimed ownership of the weapons retrieved.
They are also said to have disclosed that they were in the forest to undertake reconnaissance.
The exhibits, according to the prosecution, included a Tudor short gun, pump-action, two shotguns, assault rifles and 10 rounds of ammunition as well as a cougar pistol.
The prosecution said exhibits retrieved from the accused persons include a Tudor shotgun, a pump-action shotgun, assault rifles and 10 rounds of ammunition as well as a cougar pistol.
The team also retrieved from the accused persons 12 Gotta handsets, three handcuffs, four shovels and an electronic shocker.
The Ghana Armed Forces have commenced the second phase of their security operation to fight illegal small-scale mining.
A statement from the Ministry of Information said the exercise, dubbed ‘Operation Halt II’ is aimed at “removing all persons and logistics involved in mining on water bodies”
“The new phase of the operation focuses on the tributaries of the Pra River, which have also been significantly affected by the activities of illegal miners,” the statement added.
The Ghana Armed Forces have also commenced armed patrols of the Pra river.
The operation is being undertaken by four hundred (400) men of all ranks.
Ghanaians have been advised to stay away from mining in water bodies to avoid any action by the forces
As part of recent efforts against illegal mining, 200 military personnel were deployed to flush out illegal miners destroying water bodies in the country.
The directive was based on the suggestions the government received during the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining which took place from April 14 to 15, 2021.
The Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II is urging the government to ensure greater involvement of chiefs in the fight against illegal mining.
He says the seeming neglect of chiefs in the fight may have resulted in its failure in the past hence the need to do things differently.
Speaking at the Manhyia Palace after some officials of the Minerals Commissions called on him, the Asantehene says chiefs must be made to play a role in the fight against galamsey.
He said chiefs must also be involved in the process of issuance of mining permits, adding that the failure to get chiefs involved in such processes, forces them to get involved in the illegal mining instead, hence jeopardizing the fight.
“The constitution even says all minerals are vested in the president, but we know that the gold is vested in the soil and the local chief is in charge of the soil. 
A stranger can be given a permit to mine on the chief’s land but the maps and licence for mining are given in Accra. 
Because the chiefs are not involved, they also join in the galamsey. 
If the chief is involved in the process, this will not happen,” he said.
Illegal mining locally referred to as ‘galamsey’, has, over the past few years, dominated national conversations following a major campaign by Citi FM highlighting the devastating effects of the practice.
The fight against galamsey is assuming a wrong turn due to Government’s own past failures in the fight. As a people, we must be worried because the havoc caused by galamsey activities is life-threatening and has the potential to endanger the collective future that we all envisage.
The activities of galamseyers are gradually leading to very serious irredeemable environmental situations which include loss of biodiversity, clean water and pollution of our soil.
It is obvious that the institutional framework for the implementation of small-scale mining laws has completely broken down with corruption taking center stage. 
The failure of the Akufo Addo led government to deal with the situation within the last four years shows its weakness and incompetence in dealing with the issue of galamsey.
The just ended Stakeholders dialogue was a confirmation of the failed approach adopted by the Government in the past four years. 
We hoped that from the said Conference, new methodologies of dealing with the menace would have emerged for adoption.
Sadly, the Statement issued by the Minister of Information conveying the resolutions of the Stakeholders’ forum as a way of dealing with the menace is a false start.
The statement at best is hollow and lacks clarity as to the direction of these new operations.
The content of the statement suggests Government is involved in the business as usual and does not provide any critical out-of-the-box solution to addressing the challenge.
The President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for the umpteenth time, indicated his commitment to fighting the phenomenon of illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.
The President reiterated he will do everything in his power in his second term to bring the galamsey menace to a halt in Ghana during a courtesy call on him by  Okyehene Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori Panin and the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Council.
Prior to the meeting, the government through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources had held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.
In furtherance of the resolutions of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces, to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.
Government seems to be adopting the same failed approach in the fight against galamsey, hence there is no guarantee of improved results. We cannot continue to do things the same way and expect a different result.  
Water bodies that were regaining their natural state at the height of the fight against galamsey are becoming polluted again due to the increasing activities of illegal miners in various parts of the country.
In July 2017, President Akufo Addo served notice that he was prepared to put his Presidency on the line in his quest to fight illegal mining. 
However, considering the state of galamsey today and its devastating effect on the environment including land, rivers, and water bodies, it is clear to all and sundry that the President’s fight against galamsey has failed.
The President, having failed to fight the menace, the honorable thing to do would be for him to resign from office to uphold his integrity. 
Dishonorably, we are again treated with a plethora of promises and assurances. 
Words they say are cheap. 
The President must walk the talk. 
This galamsey matter is serious and must be given all the needed attention as a people. 
Water is life.
Delivering a speech at the National Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on Wednesday, April 14, 2021, the President said interestingly that although he is determined to enforce the laws on individuals who are caught engaging in ‘Galamsey’, he will not activate them based on mere allegations. 
No Ghanaian has said the President should convict persons based on hearsay or lack of evidence.
In any case, the President does not have the power to convict any person in Ghana – only the Courts do. 
The President’s position again demonstrates the seeming lack of interest in President Akufo Addo to tackle the galamsey menace head-on and crack down the whip on corruption.
This is in sharp contrast to promises by then Presidential Candidate of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo Addo, who indicated his readiness to differently fight corruption through, among other things, the introduction of the Anas principle, the mode of investigation used by one of Africa’s ace investigative journalists, Anas Aremeyaw to create a new culture of fear for corrupt practices.
It is therefore not surprising that up to date practically no sanctions have been meted out to Western Regional Secretary of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and former Secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Charles Bissue, for his role in the galamsey fraud scandal despite corruption allegations against him by Anas Aremayaw Anas, whose principle the President promised to adopt in the fight against corruption.  
It is also no wonder that no action has been taken in respect of the missing excavators’ saga.
Till now, no report has been issued by the Operation Vanguard Taskforce to update Ghanaians on their role, challenges, and impact in the fight against illegal mining. 
Indeed, some military officers were caught in a Joy News documentary actively engaged in the activity.
Hence, the resolutions and approach by the Government to adopt similar strategies by involving the military in an activity they have already been engaged in shows the lack of ideas and clear direction by the Government in tackling the phenomenon.
For citizens to be fully confident of the Government’s fight against galamsey, Government must report fully to Ghanaians on the activities of the Operation Vanguard Taskforce and indicate to Ghanaians the whereabouts of the missing excavators.
If the Akufo Addo-led Government wants the full support of Ghanaians in the fight against galamsey, there must be transparent and accountable and be willing to fully disclose who the interest holders are in all these galamsey sites.
Government must be clear on the sanctions it intends to impose on perpetrators as the present state of galamsey operations contravenes citizens’ rights to life, health, environment, and the principles of inter-generational equity. Furthermore, galamsey activities violate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
Mere orders to the military will not address this challenge as many of the officers themselves are complicit in the fight against illegal mining, without any known administrative actions and sanctions against them.
The Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tamale North constituency in the Northern Region, Alhassan Suhuyini. is sceptical about the government’s renewed fight against illegal mining in Ghana.
According to him, the government’s renewed commitment to tackling the menace is “structured to fail”.
His comments come on the back of the recent deployment of 200 military personnel to flush out illegal miners destroying water bodies in the country.
A statement from the Information Ministry said, “In furtherance of the resolution of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on April 14 to April 15, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.”
“The operation commenced at 0600 hours on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, on the River Pra in the Central and Western Regions of Ghana. 
Two Hundred (200) officers of the Ghana Armed Forces are involved in the operation,” the statement added.
Speaking on Citi TV‘s Breakfast Daily show on Thursday, April  29, 2021, the Tamale North legislator said the government should have supported the regional and district security services to deal with the menace, rather than deploying military men to the mining sites.
“I think this new approach to fighting galamsey, with the deployment of the military, is structured to fail. 
I think the approach should use the regional security councils, the district security councils, and then when they require backup you give them the backup.”
“Let them deal with their operational needs, and then you [government] support from the centre [to help them] carry out these activities.  
This approach will give better results than repeating what we have always done in the past. 
I think that the president should have learnt some very good useful lessons from the first fight since he himself has admitted that the last four years has been a failure, given the amount of money that we have thrown at this fight.”
The Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Samuel Jinapor, has said the fight against illegal mining, locally known as “galamsey”, is at a crossroads.
He is, however, hopeful the fight will be won.
According to him, a lot of policies and programmes have been rolled out to tackle the menace in a more sustainable way.
Speaking at a meeting with Regional Ministers at the Jubilee House, Mr. Jinapor said the government will not renege on the fight against illegal mining in the country.
“Given all that has happened so far with respect to the issues to do with small-scale mining, we are now at a crossroads. In other words, we have had a Consultative National Dialogue and have put in some arrangements to regulate small-scale mining and end the issue of galamsey once and for all in the interest of the nation.”
The government recently renewed its commitment to fight illegal mining at a National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, where stakeholders charged the government to take steps to strictly apply the country’s mining laws.
This has led to many actions being taken in that regard.
The government ordered persons undertaking prospecting activities in forest reserves across the country to indefinitely suspend such activities.
It also directed the Minerals Commission to desist from processing or granting any request for the renewal of prospecting licenses in forest reserves.
“The Minister for Lands and Natural Resources hereby directs persons and/or companies engaged in reconnaissance and/or prospecting in Forest Reserves, with or without legal authorization, to suspend such activities until further notice…
The Minister for Lands and Natural Resources has further directed the Minerals Commission, with immediate effect, not to accept, process and/or recommend the grant, including the renewal and/or extension, of reconnaissance and prospecting licenses in Forest Reserves,” a statement from the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry said.
The Minister of Information, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, says government will soon roll out a sustainability programme on the deployment of soldiers to flush out illegal miners operating in the country’s water bodies.
According to him, this measure is meant to help the government deal with illegal mining issues conclusively.
200 military personnel were deployed on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, to flush out illegal miners destroying water bodies in the country.
The Ghana Armed Forces took this decision based on a directive given it by the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.
A statement from the Information Ministry said the operation commenced on the River Pra in the Central and Western Regions.
“In furtherance of the resolution of the final communiqué of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Small Scale Mining on April 14 to April 15, and to ensure that mining within water bodies is immediately stopped; the President of the Republic, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has authorized the Ghana Armed Forces to commence an operation to remove all persons and logistics involved in mining from Ghana’s water bodies.”
“The operation commenced at 0600 hours on Wednesday, April 28, 2021, on the River Pra in the Central and Western Regions of Ghana. 
Two Hundred (200) officers of the Ghana Armed Forces are involved in the operation.”
Mr. Oppong Nkrumah in a subsequent interview with Citi News said all persons mining in the forest reserves will be flushed out.
“The Ministry of Defense and the Ghana Armed Forces would roll out in detail what the sustainability plan is to ensure that this time we get a lot more results even beyond what we got for the first time. 
The forest reserves are no-go areas for mining. 
It’s not about legal or illegal. 
That is why the president has authorised this operation of the Ghana Armed Forces to remove all persons and logistics that are being used for mining, and they are starting on the River Pra.”
A former Minister of Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Inusah Fuseini, says President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo could create a lasting legacy by ending illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.
According to him, the current generation and future ones will applaud him if he is able to end the menace.
The former Tamale Central legislator’s comments come on the back of recent statements by the president, reiterating his commitment to fighting galamsey..
President Akufo-Addo said he will do everything in his power to bring the menace to an end in his second term, which ends in January 2025.
He noted that major rivers such as the Birim and Ankobrah have been polluted due to the activities of illegal small-scale miners and, as such, he will put more effort into the fight to ensure that future generations are not deprived of the water, mineral and natural resources currently being threatened by galamsey.
“We’ve seen what has happened to River Birim, Ankobrah, and other major water bodies. 
I’ll put a lot of effort into the galamsey fight for Ghanaians to know that I’m serious about the fight so that we can bequeath to the next generation the gold, water, and other resources we inherited from our forefathers. 
Mr. Fuseini has challenged the president to walk the talk by ending the menace in order to help secure Ghana’s future.
“There is more to it than words. 
It is the action that is required, but I agree with the president and challenge him to put in more effort because he has said all the right things. 
Ghana’s ecosystem has taken us a long time to get it where it is and we cannot just watch on and allow a few miscreants to destroy it for their personal gain. 
Our ancestors knew [about] the gold that we have but they never prospected for gold in water bodies, and they never also destroy the forest cover for gold. 
They rather handed to us – this generation – an ecosystem that we were proud of and that we could even beat our chest and say that we are the largest producers of cocoa. 
This is what they handed over to us, what are we handing over to the next generation?”
“We cannot allow these greedy people to destroy it for us. 
We cannot and we must not. The president must act and act now. 
Mr. President, if you can’t create any legacy at all, the lasting legacy will be to mitigate the harmful effects of illegal small-scale mining in this country by banning such activities. 
If you so do, not only this generation but generations yet unborn will applaud you for it.”
Mr. Inusah Fuseini made the call on Citi FM/TV‘s weekend current affairs programme, The Big Issue on Saturday, April 24, 2021.
The President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has, for the umpteenth time, indicated his commitment to fighting the phenomenon of illegal small-scale mining, commonly known as galamsey in Ghana.
He said he will do everything within his power to bring the menace to an end in his second term, which ends in January 2025.
Nana Akufo-Addo said this when the Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin and other leaders of the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Council paid a courtesy call on him at the Jubilee House on Friday, April 23, 2021.
He noted that major rivers such as the Birim and Ankobrah have been polluted due to the activities of illegal small-scale miners and as such, he will put in a lot of effort into the fight to ensure that future generations are not deprived of the water, mineral and natural resources currently being threatened by galamsey.
“We’ve seen what has happened to River Birim, Ankobrah and other major water bodies. 
I’ll put in a lot of effort into the galamsey fight for Ghanaians to know that I’m serious about the fight so that we can bequeath to the next generation the gold, water and other resources we inherited from our forefathers. 
I intend to do everything within my power in this second term to bring this galamsey menace to a conclusion in Ghana,” he stated.
Illegal mining, locally referred to as ‘galamsey’, has, over the past few years, dominated national conversations following a major campaign by Citi FM highlighting the devastating effects of the practice.
In 2017, Nana Akufo-Addo declared that he was prepared to put his presidency on the line in the fight against galamsey.
His declaration was amidst new measures such as the deployment of police and military personnel to arrest illegal miners across the country and the introduction of a community mining programme aimed at regulating small-scale mining in communities in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Recently, there have been complaints that the water bodies that were regaining their natural state at the height of the fight against galamsey are becoming polluted again due to the increasing activities of illegal miners in various parts of the country.
President Akufo-Addo again made public statements on the development, saying that there is a need for an open discussion on the subject.
The government,t through the Ministry for Lands and Natural Resources, subsequently held a two-day National Consultative Dialogue on Small-Scale Mining that, among other things, urged the government to firmly enforce the country’s laws on mining.
As a result of that dialogue, the Lands Minister directed all persons prospecting or carrying out reconnaissance activities in forest reserves to cease within seven days.
The move is said to be one of many to be rolled out as part of efforts to deal with illegal small-scale mining in Ghana.
The entire cocoa industry in Ghana is at risk of collapse if the European Union (EU) carries out its threat of banning the country from its market.
This is according to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), Joseph Boahen Aidoo.
It follows threats from the EU that it will ban cocoa from Ghana if the negative impact of illegal mining on the country’s environment persists.
Mr. Boahen Aidoo, in an interview with Citi News, called on all stakeholders to help curb illegal mining in a bid to avert the collapse of the cocoa industry.
“This is a major issue because Europe takes about 80 percent of our cocoa exports. 
Should they ban or impose restrictions on us, it will be very difficult for us to sell our cocoa. 
As a nation, we need to take a position on this and fight these illegal mining activities together devoid of politics”, he said.
However, the Union is threatening the ban cocoa from Ghana because areas shown in satellite images to have been forest areas in the 70s and 80s in Ghana have all experienced land degradation in recent times.
Stakeholders in the agricultural value chain have expressed fears about the impact of the development on Ghana’s cocoa sector.
Already, the Deputy Chief Executive in-Charge of Agronomy and Quality Control at COCOBOD, Dr. Emmanuel Agyemang Dwomoh has called for immediate action to be taken to avert the possible sanctions.
“When you take the satellite images, you will see some places in red. The EU thinks that all those places are red because cocoa is causing land degradation [in Ghana], meanwhile, it is as a result of the galamsey activities”, he added.
In January 2021, the Union announced that it will contribute €25 million to enhance the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cocoa production in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Cameroon who are, respectively, the first, second and fifth-biggest cocoa producers, generating almost 70% of the world’s total production.
The European Union (EU) is threatening to ban cocoa from Ghana if the negative impact of illegal mining on the country’s environment persists.
Making a presentation at the ongoing National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining in Accra today, April 15, 2021, the Deputy Chief Executive in-Charge of Agronomy and Quality Control at COCOBOD, Dr. Emmanuel Agyemang Dwomoh, expressed fears about the impact of the development on Ghana’s cocoa sector.
Currently, Ghana exports 80 percent of its cocoa to the European Union.
Dr. Emmanuel Agyemang Dwomoh believes immediate action must be taken to avert the possible sanctions.
“As we speak, EU is threatening to ban Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, to impose legislative instrument restrictions on the importation of cocoa from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to their courts.”
He said the EU is taking this course of action because areas shown in satellite images to have been forested in the 70s and 80s in Ghana, have all experienced land degradation in the decades since.
“When you take the satellite images, you will see some places in red. The EU thinks that all those places are red because cocoa is causing land degradation [in Ghana], meanwhile, it is as a result of the galamsey activities.”
He further raised concerns about the devastating effects of the galamsey activities on the production of cocoa in Ghana and its exportation.
“The impact of these mining activities on cocoa production is enormous. 
There is crop loss, reduction of crop yield and income, loss of vegetation, the fertility of the crop soil is destroyed and [there’s also] an early dropping of immature pods as a result of the chemicals that they use,” he lamented.
In January 2021, the European Union announced that it will contribute €25 million to enhance the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cocoa production in Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Cameroon who are, respectively, the first, second and fifth-biggest cocoa producers, generating almost 70% of the world’s total production.
This funding is to strengthen the partnership between Team Europe (composed of the EU, its Member States, and European financial institutions) and the three cocoa-producing countries and aims at ensuring a decent living income for farmers, halting deforestation and eliminating child labour.
The Member of Parliament (MP) for Ningo-Prampram, Mr. Sam Nartey George, has urged President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to stop the rhetoric and hit the ground running in the galamsey fight.
In his view, President Akufo-Addo is only paying lip service to the fight against illegal small-scale mining, locally known as galamsey, instead of fighting it head-on.
According to him, the president is only giving Ghanaians nice “soundbites rather than real action”.
The Ningo-Prampram lawmaker insisted that those behind the menace are either government appointees or person aligned to the governing New Patriotic Party and thus urged the President to crack the whip to serve as a deterrent to others.
“Mr. President, it is your party national executives and regional executives, your party people, your presidential staffers, your former ministers who are engaged in the galamsey menace. 
They are the people carrying out small-scale mining and destroying our water bodies. So Mr. President, put your money where your mouth is. If you want to fight galamsey, deal with your own appointees. Stop giving us soundbites and give us real action.”
“The truth is that Mr. President, it is your party people who are doing the galamsey. 
Nobody in the NDC is engaged in it because we don’t control the security agencies that are protecting these illegal miners. We don’t manufacture excavators in this country, they all come through the port. 
So who is giving permits for those excavators to be imported? 
If the government is really committed to fighting the menace, can’t the government place a ban on the importation of all excavators?”
Mr. Sam George made the call on Citi TV‘s Breakfast Daily programme on Thursday, April 15, 2021.
His comments come on the back of the ongoing National Consultative Dialogue, a forum the President is hopeful will come out with a better roadmap for dealing with galamsey activities once and for all.
“Out of this maiden consultative dialogue, I hope we will build a national consensus around a national policy on small scale mining, that promotes a responsible, viable, environmentally sustainable small-scale mining industry, which has discarded the use of mercury, ‘changfangs’ and excavators, which has barred the involvement of foreign nationals, and which has rejected the destruction of our forests, environment and water bodies,” President Akufo-Addo said.
Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Samuel Abu Jinapor wants stiffer punishment for politicians, chiefs and kingpins behind illegal mining in Ghana.
Mr. Jinapor says dealing with such persons will go a long way to help the fight against illegal mining.
Speaking at the opening of a national dialogue on illegal mining in Ghana, Samuel Abu Jinapor said a lot more stringent actions must be taken to deal with the menace.
“How do we name, shame and punish politicians, chiefs, religious leaders and people with money and influence who are promoters of this criminal cartel in this industry?”
Another key question the minister was interested in was: “what kind of enforcement regime is required which bites and does so without fear or favour?”
The National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining, which will end today, April 15, 2021, is expected to come out with a communiqué on the solution to the illegal mining menace.
The forum has been a two-day roundtable discussion on challenges confronting the small-scale mining sector.
It has had inputs from key mining experts, the Small-Scale Mining Association, the Coalition of Civil Society Against Illegal Small-Scale Mining, among others.
Some stakeholders at the ongoing National Consultative Dialogue on Small Scale Mining have proposed the strict enforcement of mining laws as one of the solutions to the many problems in that sector.
Environmental group A Rocha Ghana has warned that the Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC) push for bauxite exploration will open doors to illegal mining.
Though the corporation has pledged to ensure safe mining activities, A Rocha feels the illegal activities will be beyond its control.
“The problem observed by GIADEC will only get worse with bauxite mining: building mining roads into closed forests opens up currently inaccessible areas to illegal operators,” A Rocha said in a statement.
“The illegal mining and logging you see today will flourish in the protected area once GIADEC facilitates access for illegal actors,” it added.
A Rocha stressed that mining in in the Atewa forest “will be a terminal cancer that will erode forest integrity and the ecosystem services they provide over time”.
It urged GIADEC to follow in the footsteps of aluminium companies that have agreed not to use raw materials sourced from the Atewa Forest.
Members of the International Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN) on November 4, 2020, voted to adopt Motion 103 calling for “Urgent measures to safeguard the globally important Atewa Forest in Ghana”.
“If GIADEC is to fulfil its stated commitment to international best practices and standards, the Atewa Forest must be completely off-limits to bauxite mining,” A Rocha said.
The Atewa Forest is a Key Biodiversity Area teeming with thousands of animal species and a source of clean drinking water for more than 5 million Ghanaians.
A Rocha Ghana has read the statements made by GIADEC during a meeting with journalists and published on Monday 5 April and is responding to key points raised.
GIADEC said it rejects as ‘propaganda’ an apparent claim that the whole of Atewa Forest will be destroyed by bauxite mining. 
It says the area it will be ‘playing’ with – a surprising term to use for an activity that will cause so much damage to livelihoods, species, habitats, and clean water – is about 10% or less over 50 years, and would mine 5 million tonnes of bauxite in that time. 
To be clear, civil society’s concerns are over the location proposed for bauxite mining – that is, the mountain tops – as this is within Atewa’s legally protected area and is also the most critical for biodiversity and clean water. Loss of the forest and habitats here would be irreversible and would also cause wider damage to the integrity and ecosystem service provision of a much greater area of forest around it. 
But GIADEC seems to completely miss this point. 
Bauxite mining in Atewa Forest, no matter how small, will be a terminal cancer that will erode forest integrity and the ecosystem services they provide overtime. 
Atewa is a critical forest ecosystem, it is not to be ‘played’ with.
The statement said that participants were briefed on a baseline biodiversity study of the proposed mining area as part of documenting the area’s life forms. 
But this is unnecessary. Several research documents both recent and old have already been published of the species found in Atewa Forest including the proposed mining area. 
These reports show that Atewa Forest contains many endangered and endemic species that would be threatened with extinction if bauxite mining goes ahead. Instead of another biodiversity report, an independent Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (ESIA) is what is urgently needed to document how mining will impact on the forest, species, habitats, ecosystem services, livelihoods and access to clean water. 
An ESIA is supposed to form part of any decision-making process over whether or not a development action should go ahead, but this has not been done.
GIADEC’s statements did claim that reclamation plans have been proposed as well as draft report produced. 
Are these documents publicly available and how can civil society access them for independent examination and validation?
Private sector investors are also urged caution. The IUCN’s Resolution 087 passed in November 2020 urging protection of the Atewa Forest and which received overwhelmingly support, “STRONGLY REQUESTS” all companies in the mining sector not to participate in any mining activities in or near Atewa Forest and all companies using aluminium to ensure that no aluminium from Atewa Forest enters their supply chains”. 
The Concerned Citizens of Atewa Landscape (CCAL) have made it very clear that they do not want mining companies entering their forests and destroying their resources, livelihoods, and clean water sources. 
Civil society supports their stand and urges caution to any private sector company interested in mining bauxite in the Atewa Forest. 
A number of aluminium user companies have already stated their objections to aluminium produced with bauxite from Atewa. 
If GIADEC is to fulfil its stated commitment to international best practices and standards, the Atewa Forest must be completely off limits to bauxite mining.
GIADEC has done one good thing, though, by raising the issue of illegal mining and forest destruction in Atewa Forest, stating we will one day “get up and find that there is no forest at all”. 
Civil society has also made this point countless times over the years. 
The destruction of state gazetted forests by illegal activities should be the concern of any state agency that has the wellbeing of Ghanaians at its centre. 
Citizens should not have to fight our government agencies to ensure that we benefit from the judicious and sustainable use of our natural resources. Or is the government and its agencies deliberately allowing the forest to be decimated by illegal actors, to serve as justification for mining it? A typical case of “give the dog a bad name so you can hang it”? (while communities continue to suffer the impacts?) 
The problem observed by GIADEC will only get worse with bauxite mining: building mining roads into closed forests opens up currently inaccessible areas to illegal operators. 
The illegal mining and logging you see today will flourish in the protected area once GIADEC facilitate access for illegal actors.
There are currently several non-extractive uses for forests such as Atewa Forest that have significant prospects of harnessing green investments that will offer quality green jobs and ensure wellbeing for all.
We urge GIADEC to work with us to explore these green investments for the benefits of Ghanaians today and tomorrow.
The Ghana Water Company Limited in the Eastern Region says activities of illegal small scale miners, popularly referred to as galamsey, continue to hinder water operations.
Currently, the water company is rationing water in most parts of the region and has on numerous occasions shut down water treatment plants at Osino, Bunso, and Kyebi as a result of activities of illegal miners.
As Ghana joins the rest of the world today to commemorate World Water Day, the Eastern Regional Public Relations Officer of the Ghana Water Company Limited, Kwadwo Daase hopes that there is a lasting solution to the galamsey menace which affects its operations.
“The challenge with production and supply of water for us on World Water Day is the raw water source that is the rivers and water bodies which serve as the raw materials for us and our concern for years is the impact of illegal mining or galamsey on these water bodies. 
Anytime we are celebrating World Water Day, we wish that we don’t talk about this menace which is still persisting in areas like Osino, Busum etc. 
Our plant there has to be suspended several times.”
He however called on residents to bear with the water company as it continues with its water demand schedules.
“The water supply cannot meet the demand in Koforidua, Somanya, Odumasi areas, etc. The advent of COVID-19 and the need for people to use water has increased the demand for water. 
We have stretched our plants to the elastic limit so we only have to deal with the only little we have, that is why we are trying to put in this water demand management schedule; whereby we supply this area for two or three days, and we revert to the other side of town which is really helping. There were complaints all over that two or three weeks we are not getting water and when we started this the people are appreciating it. ”
In January 2021, Mr Kwadwo Daase called on the government to streamline the activities of the illegal miners and some road contractors which was affecting water supply.
The GWCL had to shut down the Kyebi treatment plant due to high turbidity as a result of the activities of illegal miners operating along the Birim River.
The Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation-designate, Dr. Kwaku Afriyie, has targetted the regulation of excavators as a measure to tackle illegal mining.
Speaking during his vetting, Dr. Afriyie cited the introduction of heavy earth moving equipment to small scale mining in 1989 as the day “Ghana’s environmental problems begun.”
He thus said Ghana must regulate excavators “severely.”
To address the problem, Dr. Afriyie suggested that excavators be accounted for and banned.
“We should have a census of excavators in this country, and we should even consider a temporary ban on them.”
Decommission some of them, sell some of them off and then put a ban on some of them and by attrition get the numbers that we can use for small scale mining,” he added further.
The nominee also said the danger posed by chanfans which are used to wash minerals in water bodies should also be banned.
“We should criminalise the unlicensed manufacture of washing plants because you know that washing plant is going to be used to do galamsey in water bodies.”
In addition, he said the current generation of Ghanaians was not entitled to all the mineral resources thus, the overall act of mining should be regulated.
“We should have a law that based on the available resources we have, perhaps no more than 50 square km should be mined at any point in time just like we regulate frequency moderation in this country.”
He hopes to implement these suggestions,  should he take office.
Dr. Afiyie said the threat of illegal mining “will be severely assuaged and this country will be the better for it”.
The Ghana Armed Forces says it has commenced investigations into allegations some of its personnel are protecting illegal mining operations.
Recent media reports suggest that some members of the Ghana Armed forces are complicit in illegal mining activities though the military forms an integral part of the anti-illegal mining taskforce.
In a statement signed by the Director of Public Affairs for the Ghana Armed Forces, Colonel Aggrey Quashie, the Military command says it does not condone such acts and will appropriately sanction any of its personnel complicit in the illegal practice.
“The Ghana Armed Forces has taken notice of media reports alleging that some of its personnel have been involved in providing security for illegal mining operations. 
The Ghana Armed Forces take such allegations seriously as it does not condone such wrongdoing if true.”
“Accordingly, a full-scale investigation has commenced into the allegations and appropriate sanctions to be handed out to any person or persons found out. 
The Ghana Armed forces also assure the general public of its unflinching commitment to the national course,” it added.
In March 2020, the government officially withdraw the military component of its anti-illegal mining taskforce, Operation Vanguard, from the field.
Operation Vanguard started as a Military-Police Joint Task Force set up in 2017 to combat the operations of illegal miners in Ghana.
But taskforce’s operations have been marred by controversy amid allegations of corruption.
In one instance, three soldiers of the task force were investigated for allegedly trying to extort money from illegal miners in the Wassa Akropong area in the Western Region.
The Concerned Small Scale Miners Association has welcomed President Akufo Addo’s call for an open stakeholder discussion on illegal small-scale mining popularly known as galamsey.
The Association says the move is a step in the right direction since all attempts to use security forces to clamp down on the activity has failed to yield the desired results.
The President of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Association, Michael Kojo Peprah in a Citi News interview said President Akufo-Addo’s call vindicates the association on their earlier stance that the deployment of military personnel to clamp down on the illegal activity will not yield any result.
He said the government must bring together all stakeholders and receive their inputs on how best to tackle the phenomenon.
“They should understand that, in the beginning, we told them that all these things about bringing the military will not help. In 1989, they brought the military it failed, 2000, 2012 it all failed. So when do we always do the same things and expect a different result? 
What they have come to realize is that what we were saying is true. They should extend their hand, and we will all come and all the expertise and solutions we have, we will put it on paper and help mother Ghana, so the country will benefit from mining,” he said.
President Akufo-Addo in delivering the last State of the Nation address in his first term on Tuesday, January 5, 2021, said it’s about time the government, traditional leaders and various stakeholders in the mining industry discuss the impact of illegal mining on the country devoid of politics.
“There is one subject…I believe we the people need to have an open conversation, and that is the phenomenon of galamsey. 
Should we allow or not allow galamsey?” President Akufo-Addo said.
“We have to talk about galamsey. We who are leaders owe it to the country to take the subject out of the party political area and have an honest conversation about this menace to our future,” he added.
A former Member of Parliament (MP) for the Bantama constituency and the Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Henry Kokofu has called on the flagbearer of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), John Dramani Mahama to stop politicising galamsey issues in the country.
Mr. Mahama has promised to retrieve all confiscated excavators and concessions belonging to small scale miners in the country if he wins the 2020 elections.
According to him, President Akufo-Addo has failed in his promise to fix the problems facing small-scale miners in Ghana.
But Mr. Kokofu believes the NDC flagbearer should be blamed for all the challenges the country is facing in dealing with the menace.
The EPA Executive Director insisted that the activities of the illegal miners heightened during the former President’s tenure.
“I don’t understand the basis for the hypocrisy about the galamsey fight from NDC because it was under their tenure that the activities of galamsay heightened in this country; from 2011, 2012, up to 2014 and leading to 2016.”
“…But for me, it is not about apportioning blame. 
We as a nation through President Akufo-Addo have decided to fight this and that is where the focus should be. 
We shouldn’t focus on the propaganda gimmicks going around saying he will give back the seized excavators. 
So he should stop this propaganda he is doing.”
He made these comments when he appeared on the news review segment of Citi TV’s Breakfast Daily on Thursday, October 22, 2020.
In a related issue, the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh has debunked claims that the government has sold a number of the excavators that were seized at the height of the war against illegal mining in Ghana
According to the sector minister, such claims by the NDC that some excavators are missing, sold and stolen do not hold water.
“The number we have is 157 at Adentan, Obuasi, and Tarkwa. 
The number that I have provided are numbers that are on site. 
The place is not walled, they can go and check. The claim by NDC that 500 excavators are missing, sold, and stolen is neither here nor there.”
Mr. Asomah-Cheremeh further challenged any individual who has proof of the said allegations, to produce evidence to authenticate the said transactions.
“I stood at the Prestea-Huni valley area in February and told journalists that the government or the ministry has not done any such thing, but the accusations persist. 
Whoever thinks otherwise should come forward with better particulars,” he dared.
Hundreds of angry miners have vowed not to leave the concession of the Ghana Rubber Estate Limited (GREL) near Adiewoso in the Western Region.
The miners openly resisted moves by uniformed personnel in the Operation Vanguard team to forcefully eject them from the concession.
According to them, they are operating legal community mines and will not leave the site, swearing not to end their operations there since that is their only source of livelihood.
Superintendent Douglas Kumi, the officer commanding for Operation Vanguard in the Western Region said their intention was to invite the leadership of the miners to engage with them on their operations and ascertain if their activities were legal.
He said they are disappointed in the leadership over their inability to control the miners in their conduct hence the security personnel will go back to their station, reorganize themselves and return to the site.
“Looking at the numbers and the situation, we will withdraw and get organized again.”
“We cannot arrest all the people and therefore we have also not inspected their documents to know whether what they are doing is legal or illegal. 
We came with the intention of taking the leadership, sit down with them and know their background… 
But the leadership has proven to me this morning that they will not be able to control the people and if that is so, as police we will go back and reorganize,” he said.
One of the miners who spoke to Citi News said their operations are not illegal.
“This is the community mining project for Ahanta West. This morning, police came here to drive us away. We are not doing this without permission. 
Look at the number of people doing this work, this is not illegal, we are not thieves. 
The government paid for our education at the University for Mines and Technology (UMAT) and opened this community mining project for us. 
Our chiefs engaged the government for us to begin this project. We’ve done nothing wrong,” he said.
The Ghana Rubber Estates Limited, GREL, last week lamented over the illegal occupation of its lands by what it said was politically induced galamsey.
The company said the development threatens their investment of about £550,000.
The natural rubber producers who in 2018 with the support of the One-District-One-Factory begun expansion of its production by 25,000 tons per annum.
This illegal invasion of GREL lands will certainly affect directly the raw material base needed for the two factories and also defeats the purpose of the support GREL had from the One District One Factory Initiative for the construction of the 1st Phase of its new rubber processing factory,” the company said in a statement.
Meanwhile, reacting to the development, the Corporate Affairs Manager of GREL, Perry Acheampong, reacting to the allegations by the galamseyers that they have permits to operate Community Mines after the Operation Vanguard failed to halt their operations said the have not permitted any such activity in their concession.
“Ghana Rubbber Estate Limited has 50-year lease to operate and has not given out any part of our concession in the area for Community Mines. 
In fact, we complained about the galamsey activities in our concession to the assembly which they told us they would investigate. 
If the government at any point approach as they want to to have a portion of our concession for such activity, we are ready to have a discussion on it but what is going on there is illegal since we haven’t given out any part.”
“The forcible take-over of GREL lands by several communities for Galamsey activities is an act of illegality that has to be condemned and the instigators or perpetrators brought to book. 
This illegal invasion of GREL lands will certainly affect directly the raw material base needed for the two factories and also defeats the purpose of the support GREL had from the One District 
One Factory Initiative for the construction of the 1st Phase of its new rubber processing factory. 
It also puts at risk Ghana Rubber Estates Limited since the availability of land is very key to its existence, hence, without the availability of land for its nucleus plantation GREL will not be able to operate…
The activity if not stopped could affect an estimated area of 350 acre part of GREL Estate Division 3 located near Adeiwoso on the Apimenim-Elubo Highway. The area was planted with rubber in 1960’s and GREL recultivated it with rubber again in 2010. 
The investment done by GREL from 2010 to date is about £550,000 which could be lost if they are not stopped. 
GREL could also lose 3.5million of revenue over the next 30 years if that area is destroyed.”
Social commentator Sidney Casely-Hayford has described the government’s reported plans to use drones to fight illegal small mining after restructuring Operation Vanguard as a waste of time.
Speaking on The Big Issue, Mr. Casely-Hayford said he thought it was “a brain-dead solution” and that such a plan “will die before it is even born.”
“This a waste of time. It is not the answer to the problem,” he added.
These reported plans accompanied reports that the government will from March 2020 withdraw the military component of its anti-illegal mining taskforce, Operation Vanguard, from the field.
To continue effective monitoring of the sector, Citi News sources said the government was going to rely on mining guards and 144 drone pilots who are under the Nation Builders Corps.
But Mr. Casely-Hayford remarked that such plans have not been thought through.
“I think that we have not sat down to critically decide how we want to resolve this problem [of illegal mining],” he said.
He reiterated that whatever plan the government came up with must focus “on guaranteeing the cleanliness of the water bodies.”
“As to how somebody the ground and gets it, give them the regulations. 
If you dig and don’t find any gold or dig up as much gold as you want, leave the place in the condition you found it.”
Findings by some lecturers in the Political Science Department of the University of Ghana cited the fight against illegal mining as the second most disliked government policy.
As part of this policy, over 200 drones were procured by the government to assist its fight against illegal smal scale mining across the country.
The drones are used to take live images in districts where the practice is rampant.
Recent trainees underwent training in how to operate the drones at the George Grant University of Mines and Technology at Tarkwa in the Western Region.
The withdrawals of the soldiers was also a reminder for some that observers had described such an approach as unsustainable.
The failings of the military over the years started with the late 1980s where the first recorded nationwide operation against illegal mining was undertaken after the passage of the Small Scale Mining Law, PNDCL 218, 1989.
Another military operation took place in November 2006 named “Operation Flush Out” and was noted for allegations of human rights abuses.
In 2013 the government sanctioned a security operation under the banner of an “Inter-Ministerial Taskforce” which made use of military personnel.
The Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA) is shocked that the Office of the Special Prosecutor declined to probe acts of corruption hampering the fight against illegal mining in the country.
ASEPA had petitioned the office to probe the mining sector and ensure the enforcement of small scale mining laws with a focus on the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining and the anti-illegal mining task force, Operation Vanguard following the disappearance of hundreds of excavators seized from illegal miners.
But the Office in a response to the petition indicated that the matter presented does not raise questionable issues in terms of corruption to warrant its attention.
Reacting to the latest development on Eyewitness News, Executive Director of ASEPA, Mensah Thompson disclosed that his outfit will resort to the law courts to get the Special Prosecutor to conduct the necessary inquiry into the matter.
“I am very much disappointed at the response of the office of the Special Prosecutor. 
The response smacks of some inconsistencies and dishonesty in the way the Special Prosecutor responded. 
Our next line of action is to refer the matter to our lawyers. 
We have a meeting coming up to consider what will be the issues in terms of the law. 
We want to assure the good people of Ghana that this matter has not ended yet because we are determined to get to the bottom of the matter. 
We will look at local remedies available to us including International Union on the Conservation of Nature and other international bodies that deal with the protection of the environment. 
These are serious matters that we do not have to joke with,” said Mr. Thompson.
The letter signed by the Special Prosecutor, Martin Amidu explained that the Police Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had already launched a full-scale investigation into the matter.
The Special Prosecutor in the letter said the CID is in a better position to handle the issue.
“A review of your letter of complaint, however, has led this Office to the conclusion that the facts and conjects upon which underpin your complaint do not raise any issues of corruption and corruption-related offences as narrowly defined under section 79 of office of the Special Prosecutor Act, 2017 (Act 959) to warrant any investigations by this Office,” Martin Amidu added in the letter.
ASEPA had said recent allegations of corruption in the fight against illegal mining “show that the whole fight against illegal mining was a sham and a plot to get licensed small scale miners out of business so that some elements in the government can take over small scale mining in the country.”
The group further held that the allegations “border on offences such as stealing, bribery, corruption, abuse of public office for private gain and other serious offences” which fall under the purview of the Special Prosecutor.
So far, six persons have been arrested in connection with the missing excavators and since granted bail.
The six, include the suspended First Vice Chairman of the New Patriotic Party in the Central Region, Ekow Ewusi, who was also heard in an audio recording with the Environment, Science and Technology Minister, Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng discussing the prospect of mining on some concessions.
The Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation, Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng has denied allegations that his son, Jojo Frimpong-Boateng is involved in mining in Ghana’s forest reserves.
He indicated that such allegations are untrue.
Prof. Frimpong-Boateng issued the disclaimer in an interview with journalists on Thursday after the President’s State of the Nation Address.
Prof. Frimpong-Boateng told journalists that “he [his son] is not involved in anything and the world will get to know soon.”
There were some reports that a company linked to the son of Prof. Frimpong-Boateng, Jojo Frimpong Boateng, was involved in illegal mining.
The reports were trumpeted by some members of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) as well as the Assin Central legislator, Kennedy Agyapong.
Kennedy Agyapong had alleged that some mining excavators seized by the government from alleged illegal miners had been given to Jojo Frimpong-Boateng through Ekow Ewusi who is currently being held by police over the disappearance of seized excavators.
Speaking on his Net2 television, Kennedy Agyapong said, “How can you seize people’s excavators for illegal mining and turn around to give it your son for his mining activities?”
The Minister in the interview also denied any involvement in alleged corruption in the fight against illegal mining.
“Everything that I have done in this world is for Ghanaians. 
I have not done anything for myself. Look at me; I have not taken bribes before. 
I have not extorted money from anybody before. I have not done anything wrong before,” he said.
There have been calls for him to resign or be axed during the aftermath of revelations about the disappearance of hundreds of excavators seized from illegal miners.
The Ranking Member on the Mines and Energy Committee of Parliament, Adam Mutawakilu, even called for his arrest.
However, the Minister remained resolute when queried on the matter insisting that the state will get to the bottom of the controversy.
All seized mining excavators that have gone missing will soon be found.
This is according to Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation.
According to him, the country’s security agencies are following up on the issue closely and will soon bring it to its logical conclusion.
The sector minister who has come under serious attack from a section of the public over his inability to account for all the equipment seized from illegal miners said he is confident that every stolen equipment will be found.
He told journalists on Thursday that “every excavator that has been stolen will be found…
I don’t want to overstep what the security people are doing so let us be patient. You will get the facts pretty soon.”
It was revealed that the excavators seized by Operation Vanguard from illegal miners and some small scale mining companies which flouted the ban on small scale mining had gone missing.
There were allegations that some top members of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) were involved in illegal mining and they had appropriated some of the excavators to themselves despite the public campaign against the practice.
The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) had said that the government’s ban on small scale mining was only a “smokescreen” to kick out other miners and allow persons aligned to the NPP space to mine clandestinely whilst the ban was still in force.
Jojo Frimpong-Boateng, son of the Minister is amongst those accused of being involved in illegal mining and using a missing excavator for the act in some of the country’s forest reserves.
But the Minister said the allegation against his son is false.
“He [Jojo Frimpong-Boateng] is not involved in anything and the world will get to know soon,” the Minister said.
Meanwhile, the suspended First Vice-Chairman of the NPP in the Central Region, Horace Ekow Ewusi who has become the centre of the controversial issue of the missing equipment has been captured in a viral video allegedly claiming that he together with the NPP General Secretary, Boadu were tasked by the sector minister to use the seized excavators to mine in various concessions.
The money raised from these activities, Mr. Ewusi alleged would help fund the political activities of the NPP.
John Boadu subsequently denied the allegation.
Prof. Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng had petitioned the Criminal Investigations Department of the Ghana Police Service to investigate Horace Ekow Ewusi over his alleged involvement in the missing earth-moving equipment.
So far, six persons arrested over the disappearance of the missing equipment have been granted bail.
President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has renewed his commitment to tackling the issue of illegal small scale mining popularly referred to as ‘galamsey’ in the country.
Delivering the State of the Nation Address in Parliament on Thursday, the President indicated that government still stands by its position to use all available means to address the galamsey menace which continues to destroy large portions of the country’s vegetation cover and water resources.
This comes at a time when many have taken on the government for what they consider as government’s failure to deal with the menace as promised in the run-up to the 2016 general elections.
While commending the efforts of the media coalition against galamsey and the Inter-ministerial Committee against Illegal Mining, Nana Addo mentioned that he will ensure that no one in government neglects his or her responsibility in the fight to protect Ghana’s environment.
“When we came into office in January 2017, galamsey activities were rampant in many parts of the country. Our lands, forests and river bodies were being systematically degraded and destroyed without any care and this had been the case for several years. 
The previous NDC government had given up the fight against galamsey but we determined that this was an intolerable situation and we owed it to generations unborn to tackle the problem and save our environment. 
I was therefore not under any illusion about the size and scope of the problem that we are taking on.”
“I was cheered by the support of the large population that recognized the dangers posed by the degradation of our lands and water bodies and the needless deaths of many young people who were buried alive in makeshift mining pits. Mr. Speaker, the threat posed to the future of our country by galamsey is grave. 
We cannot shirk our responsibility in the fight against galamsey. Government will not weaken its stance and welcomes the continued support of the media coalition. 
The Inter-ministerial Committee against Illegal  Mining has been working very hard and has some successes.”
The governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) says the fight against illegal mining popularly known as “galamsey” should be depoliticized.
The menace according to the party, affects all and thus a collective effort is needed to tackle it.
This appeal comes on the back of accusation by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) that the government has failed to deal with illegal mining; a situation that is adversely affecting the country.
Director of Communications for the NPP, Yaw Buaben Asamoa said all hands must be on deck to end galamsey.
“We are aware that, the allegations of the missing excavators have brought the issue of galamsey to the fore. 
Happily, the matter has been referred to the police. 
We expect institutions of enforcement to be bold about it. 
Ideally, we would have wished the NDC leadership will deal with us rather than engage in petty politics that divide us. 
We believe that this should have been bi-partisan so that we deal with it in the context of challenges that face all of us and in a better way. 
Typical of the NDC, they have reduced this whole thing into three things – blame the president, scream loudly that the solution is not working and seek for the vote of the people without any alternative.”
In the past week, the NDC has described the government’s fight against galamsey as a failure because of several actions by government appointees and the issue of missing seized equipment.
But the NPP, on the other hand, has absolved itself from any wrongdoing insisting the fight against the menace is in full force.
Already, various bodies have called on the government to provide details on the progress or otherwise made on the fight against galamsey, with the NDC, demanding for a public exhibition of the seized excavators.
There has been so much talk about the fight against illegal mining in the last few months. 
This is partly because of how concerted the effort to rid the country of the menace was. 
Then, in recent weeks, how apparent it seems now that the battle against illegal mining has been lost.
In light of the above, we need to do some introspection of how the crusade against illegal small scale mining began, take a look at some of the gains made and how things started falling apart three years down the line. 
This is necessary because it will put things in perspective. 
It is also very necessary because the first gentleman’s job is on the line.
In 2016, Citi FM spearheaded the crusade against illegal small scale mining.
At the time, major water bodies in the Western, Ashanti and Eastern regions that supplied water to over ten million residents in these areas were heavily polluted.
The Ankobra, Offin and Birim rivers were the focal points. 
The Ghana Water Company warned of dire consequences at the time. 
The Company that treats water and distributes to our homes said if the situation was not addressed by stakeholders, the near future would be calamitous for the country. 
It warned at the time that Ghana may be resorting to the importation of water in the next two decades if the problem was not addressed. Because of the turbidity of the water bodies mentioned, its production plants had to work extra to purify water for domestic consumption and most of the river bodies were drying up or being polluted beyond redemption.
This generated considerable discussion in the country, compelling government to institute some measures.
Government eventually placed a ban on all forms of small scale mining in May 2017.
It set up the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM). IMCIM is made up of ten ministries including the Lands and Natural Resources, Defence, Interior, Local Government and Rural Development, Regional Re-organization, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Monitoring and Evaluation, Information, Sanitation & Water Resources, and Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) as chair for the committee.
A military and police team christened Operation Vanguard was subsequently commissioned by the IMCIM with four operating bases in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western and Central regions. 
Their mandate was to flush out all illegal miners and enforce the ban on all forms of small scale illegal mining.
Their mandate was to streamline the activities of Operation Vanguard and the small scale mining licensing regimes. 
A year after its inauguration in 2018, it vetted and issued licenses to over 600 miners to go back to work.
In 2017, the Chief Justice also designated seven (7) High Courts and Seven (7) Circuit Courts located in Accra, Sekondi, Kumasi, Cape Coast, Koforidua, Sunyani and Bolgatanga to deal with all mining offences committed under the Minerals and Mining Act, (Act 703). Indeed, Parliament also amended the Minerals and Mining Act, to prescribe harsher punishments for offenders.
Mandated State institutions like the Forestry Commission and the Minerals Commission were strengthened to enforce the laws on small scale mining.
The IMCIM also acquired technologies like Galamstop, an App that integrated activities of all regulatory bodies in the fight against illegal mining.
The ban on all forms of small scale mining was partially lifted in December 2018 a year after its enforcement. 
It saw over 600 miners vetted and cleared to go back to mine in an environmentally friendly manner. 
The vetting had begun a month earlier, thus November 2018.
Let me take you through some of the rudiments these miners went through before they were given the permits to mine again. 
All registered small-scale miners whose licenses were operational as at April 1, 2017, were to submit all relevant documentation to the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) Secretariat, before Friday, September 7, 2018.
The documents they are expected to present include Mining License, Environmental Permit, Operating Permit, Certificate of Registration, Tax Identification Number, two copies of passport size photos, Birth Certificate, Passport or Voter’s ID and current contact details.
Miners who sailed through the vetting were cleared eventually return to their sites.
Another group GalamSTOP Taskforce was commissioned by IMCIM on 29th September, 2019 to augment activities of Operation Vanguard. 
This parallel force has been questioned as its role has not been properly clarified.
The IMCIM Secretariat also procured drones to monitor activities of illegal miners, especially in the forest reserves. 
My checks with the IMCIM indicate that a total of 144 drone pilots from the Nation’s Builders Corps, were trained. 10 of the trainees were assigned to IMCIM, 18 for Operation Vanguard and 15 for the Minerals Commission.
It also acquired speed boats to aid Operation Vanguard to flush out illegal miners operating along water bodies. 
As of 2019, Operation Vanguard had arrested about 2,000 illegal Miners with Chinese and Ghanaians being the worst culprits.
At the peak of the campaign, there were reported cases of water bodies returning to their natural states. 
The government also introduced the community mining project in 2019, to streamline mining for interested indigenes in mining areas.
On the back of these gains, the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, scored their achievement at 70 percent.
Gains have been made but there are some major setbacks militating against the Stop Galamsey fight.
The secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Charles Bissue, for instance, was implicated in a documentary allegedly taking a bribe to aid the issuance of mining license
He has since stepped down from his role as Secretary to the Committee. 
He was cleared of the allegations by the Criminal Investigations Department. 
But the Special Prosecutor arm of the investigations is still ongoing albeit slow.
There have been allegations of bribery and extortion against members of Operation Vanguard. 
This is seriously affecting their operations.
Forestry Commission officials have also stated on record that some powerful politicians are behind the illegal small scale mining enterprise, making it practically difficult for them to enforce the law.
The slow pace of prosecution of arrested illegal miners is also worsening matters.
The latest in the twist of events, is the case of the missing excavators. 
The Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), Prof. Frimpong Boateng alleged that some seized excavators have gone missing.
During the peak of the crusade between 2017 and 2019, about five hundred excavators were seized from illegal miners. 
They were to be kept in the custody of the police by law.
In Ghana’s mining laws all seized or confiscated item should be supervised by state security agencies like the police, military or immigration.
Reports of the disappearance of the excavators and the subsequent arrest of an official of IMCIM, who is also the suspended Central regional NPP vice-chairman, Horace Ekow Ewusi and six others beg for answers.
Another mind-boggling announcement by the small scale miners was that the ounces of gold seized by IMCIM at the period are also missing.
These are serious allegations President Akufo-Addo must investigate if he really meant putting his job on the line. Mind you the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM) is directly under the Presidency.
As a mining reporter who has followed and reported on mining issues, I now understand why many at the time said the formation of the IMCIM was counter-productive. 
From all indications, it has been. 
Its Secretary, Charles Bissue has been implicated for allegedly taking bribes. 
He is still being investigated by the Office of the Special Prosecutor.
Its Chairman, Professor Frimpong Boateng has also been caught on tape in a conversation that seems to suggest he had and his party sought to privately profit from the confiscation of the excavators to fund their political party’s activities. 
That is scandalous, to say the least.
The cost of an excavator ranges between 270,000 USD and 320,000 USD. 
It costs between GHS2,200 and GHS2,700 to rent an excavator for a day (that’s 8 hours). 
How could they have done this?
How do we salvage the already damaged reputation of IMCIM? 
It does not need any salvaging; it must be completely dissolved. 
Its Chairman should have been fired or made to resign by now. 
The Minerals Commission can do a better job. 
There are laws that regulate the small scale mining space. 
The Minerals Commission is now decentralised. 
It has regional and district offices. 
The recent addition is the Regional office in Tamale. 
It has added four new mining district offices in addition to the existing nine and opened eight new satellite offices. 
It has also recently recruited 71 people and 220 Mining wardens to assist the Commission. 
While this may not be enough, there is clearly some capacity at the Minerals Commission and with their institutional understanding of the mining space, they are better placed to take over from the IMCIM.
After the dissolution of IMCIM, innovations like Galamstop, the drones and the numerous vehicles should be given to the Minerals Commission to bolster their resources and strengthen their hand to enable them do a superior job.
The Member of Parliament (MP) for Tamale North, Alhassan Suhuyini has urged the President to account for all items seized in the fight against illegal mining.
Already, various bodies have called on the government to provide details on the progress or otherwise made on the fight against galamsey, with the National Democratic Congress (NDC), demanding for a public exhibition of the seized excavators.
Alhassan Suhuyini, on the Floor of Parliament on Tuesday, said: “His Excellency the President who boldly put his Presidency on the line to demonstrate how much this course meant to him, if for nothing at all, Mr. Speaker, has his Presidency to save and it will be important that he starts by accounting for and to the people of Ghana all equipment, vehicles, weapons, ammunition and gold which were seized and kept by officers he commissioned to help end illegal mining and if necessary, penalize all who have proven to be negligent or complicit in what may have gone wrong.”
He also urged the House to probe the amount of money released for the fight against illegal mining and whether it was used for the right purpose.
“Mr. Speaker, in the face of what is clearly less than a successful campaign, I suggest humbly that your Parliament also shows more interest in how funds approved for this exercise to the various institutions have truly be expended and the results attained. 
Because these are funds belonging to the people whose interest we in all humility represent,” he added.
The NDC has asked the government to account for all excavators and ammunition seized during the Stop Galamsey Campaign.
According to the Communications Director of the party, Sammy Gyamfi, the government had seized 900 excavators during the campaign.
He cited figures in the 2020 budget presented in Parliament to support his claim.
Addressing a press conference on the banks of River Pra at Twifo Praso in the Central Region on Sunday, Mr. Gyamfi challenged the government to make a public presentation on the state of the items.
A former Minister for Environment, Science and Technology under the erstwhile Mahama administration, Akwasi Oppong Fosu, has called for an intensive investigation into the missing excavators case.
Mr. Fosu in an interview said an intensive investigation into the matter will bring some finality to the issue.
The Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council has also thrown its weight behind calls for Akufo-Addo to take a keen interest in the alleged missing excavators and gold saga.
The latest call comes on the back of a similar one made by the Concerned Small Scale Miners.
In an interview with Citi News, General Secretary of the Council, Rev. Emmanuel T. Barrigah said the Council expects that people found culpable in the ongoing investigations will be dealt with.
Meanwhile, the Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA) has petitioned the Office of the Special Prosecutor to investigate alleged corruption in the enforcement of small scale mining laws.
ASEPA wants the Inter-Ministerial Committee against Illegal Mining and the anti-illegal mining task force, Operation Vanguard, to be the focus of the probe by the Special Prosecutor.
In the petition, it highlighted the need for “full investigations into the misappropriation of seized items such as excavators, mining equipment, gold and weapons by the IMCIM through the fight against illegal mining.”
The missing excavators brouhaha began when Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that some of the excavators which were seized from illegal miners between 2017 and 2018 had vanished.
The suspended NPP Central Regional Vice Chairman, Ekow Ewusi who was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping was then seen as a suspect to the case.
The Ghana Water Company Limited in the Ashanti Region has warned that its treatment plant at Odaso could soon be shut down if urgent measures are not taken to prevent illegal miners from polluting the Odaso River.
According to the Ashanti Regional water Quality Assurance Manager, Alhaji Adam Yakubu, the state of the Odaso treatment plant keeps worsening by the day as a result of galamsey activities in the area.
He further added that the Owabi treatment plant is also being threatened as a result of the activities of private encroachers.
He believes designating the area as a security zone will help resolve the matter.
“The catchment area is being encroached by private developers and as a result of the activities of these private developers,  the Owabi dam has silted to a level that the depth which used to be 22.5ft has now reduced to 6ft and if we don’t take time, the Owabi dam will be completely silted and that could have serious ramifications for the people of Kumasi,” Alhaji Yakubu said.
The Ghana Water Company Limited, a few months ago began rationing water supply to Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis and the Effia-Kwesimintsim Municipality.
This was due to the onset of the dry season which has resulted in the inadequate water supply to the treatment plant at Inchaban.
The ongoing water rationing in the Western Region according to GWCL officials is likely to be prolonged.
According to them, this has drastically reduced their production volumes from a peak of 4.5 million gallons per day to 2.3 million gallons.
The Production Manager at the Western Regional office of GWCL, Vincent Opoku Ware Darko, in an interview with Citi News on the sidelines of a desilting exercise at the Daboase treatment plant a few days ago said the situation might worsen if measures are not adopted to curb the activities of illegal miners.
“The weather itself has an effect on the volume of water we can draw. 
We are in the dry season and in this season, we have a lot of evaporation because the weather is very dry so most of the water is taken out. 
And then, we have this galamsey issue where we have a lot of silt at the intake site and with this galamsey activity ongoing, it brings a lot of silt that they deposit at our intake. 
So we need to take these silts out so we can produce a lot of water,” he said.
Continuous illegal mining activities in the Wassa East District and beyond, which have resulted in the pollution the Pra River, is having a devastating effect on nearby communities.
The Shama District might not have galamsey activities ongoing along the Pra River, but the hidden operations of illegal gold miners around Daboase in the Wassa East District and beyond have resulted in the brownish colour of the Pra River, posing a danger to communities who depend on the river for water.
In the Shama District alone, there are over six communities along the River Pra which have been affected greatly by the pollution from galamsey, including the Bosomdo community.
These communities do not have any choice but to use the heavily polluted water from the Pra.
Citi News’ Akwasi Agyei Annim, who visited some of the communities, reported that these challenged communities are without health centres or even CHPS compounds.
One of the residents noted: “Because of the galamsey, we can’t do anything about [the Pra River] It is dirty and so bad. 
Sometimes you have to put alum inside before you can cook with it. 
It is the only source of water here. 
We use it to cook or wash dishes. 
We can’t bath with it or wash our clothes because it is salty. 
We are hoping the government will give us boreholes,” one woman pleaded.
The caretaker chief of Shama Bosomdo also added that: “Some people recently drank the water and had diarrhoea because of its poor quality. 
They cannot live without drinking water so they have no choice. 
We buy sachet water from Beposo, which at times we don’t get a steady supply of. 
So we plead with the government to come to the mercy of the Bosomdo and Krobo communities.”
Some fishermen complained about the negative impact the state of the river is having on their businesses.
“We don’t get enough catch when we go fishing because of the galamsey which has destroyed the water. 
Our nets only catch mud when we throw them in so our fishing business has been destroyed and we don’t know what to do now.”
The effects of the pollution of the Pra River, which has affected water supply, go beyond businesses to even education.
The Bosomdo D/A Primary School’s kindergarten is facing a severe shortage of teachers due to the water supply problem, while Primaries one to six, which under normal circumstances, must have a minimum of six teachers, have only four teachers including the headmaster as most teachers are unwilling to stay in the community.
Despite all these potential health risks associated with the use of polluted water from the Pra, the community, just like its neighbours, has no health centre to deal with disease outbreaks.
The Shama District Director of Health, Alfred Osei-Assibey, reacting to the concerns of communities along the river, revealed that skin infections and water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea, are on the rise in the communities.
“In the last three years, skin diseases have increased dramatically. 
From the 5,000 cases we recorded in 2017, now we are recording over 10,000 cases of skin infections. 
The diarrhoea cases have also risen from 6th in 2017 and now its number 3,” he said.
The Shama District Assembly, which is responsible for the provision of quality water for its residents, says it is aware of water the problems.
The National Farmers and Fishermen Association has warned of the devastating effect on Ghana’s cocoa industry if measures are not put in place to end illegal mining.
The Association insisted that the practice of turning cocoa farms into mining concessions is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
President of the Association, Davis Narh Korboe speaking at a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo at the Jubilee House said the practice is unfavourable to the growth of the cocoa industry.
“For instance, cocoa farms are being cut down every now and then and what we are saying is that in as much as people want to make money from mining, then concession, we should look at prime cocoa and exclude them from these mining activities so that our farmers can really produce,” he said.
Some Ghanaians have already given up on the fight against galamsey saying that the fight has been lost.
The leader of the Special Team set up by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal mining to monitor, investigate, evacuate and arrest persons involved in illegal mining, Nana Yaw Boadu, had earlier stated that the team will expeditiously investigate and make sure that everyone involved in illegal mining is brought to book as it probes the issue of the missing excavators.
According to him, the issue will be treated as very important and no cover-up will be entertained.
“Now what we plan on doing is that we are not going to entertain any cover-up again. 
We are going with a camera to the site. 
So, when we enter the site, the camera will monitor everything. 
We want Ghanaians to know whatever is happening at the mining site. 
So, when you are doing the right thing, Ghanaians will know. 
When you are not too, they will know,” he said.
The suspended New Patriotic Party (NPP) Central Regional Vice Chairman, Horace Ekow Ewusi was earlier arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) for his alleged involvement in the disappearance of some excavators seized from illegal miners in the country.
It will be recalled that at the peak of the fight against illegal mining between 2017 and 2018, about 500 earth-moving machines were seized by the Lands and Natural Resources Ministry.
The then sector Minister, John Peter Amewu who sanctioned the seizure directed them to be parked at the premises of the various Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs).
Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology & Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that most of the excavators that were seized from illegal miners had vanished.
The Concerned Small Scale Miners Association subsequently told the Minister that they knew where the missing excavators were.
Ekow Ewusi was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping.
The Convener of the Media Coalition Against Illegal Mining, Ken Ashigbey, has described the country’s justice delivery system as a weak link in relation to the fight against illegal mining.
His comments come in the wake of the arrest of some individuals over some missing excavators and other seized equipment from illegal miners in the country.
Speaking on the Point of View on Wednesday, he called on the government to bring all cases related to the missing excavators to the capital, Accra to be prosecuted so the utmost focus can be given to the case.
“It [the judiciary] has been one of the weakest links. 
Before this excavator issue came, it was the weakest link because the last time I heard the Operation Vanguard commander talking, he was talking about 5% convictions. All of us have been complaining about it. 
I remember the Media Coalition petitioned in the situation in which Chinese were arrested and then prosecuted in a circuit court in Tarkwa. And these are foreigners. 
So even before the law was amended, the sanction for them was not GH¢2,400 fines. 
It was more than that if you were just going to do fines.”
“So definitely the justice delivery system is a problem. 
I remember speaking to one of the Supreme Court judges and his suggestion was the fact that to really deal with this issue, let’s bring every case, these galamsey cases to Accra, have the focus on it and prosecute them here. Because once you get them into these places all kinds of things happen. 
You would not have the situation where goats and things will change hands,” he said.
Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng, the Minister for Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation and also Chairperson for the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining (IMCIM), disclosed recently that some of the excavators which were seized from illegal miners between 2017 and 2018 had vanished.
Some members of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Association subsequently revealed that they knew the whereabouts of the missing excavators, with claims that they were being used for galamsey in parts of the country.
Ekow Ewusi who was contracted by the government to cart excavators and other vehicles and pieces of equipment seized by Operation Vanguard to designated areas for safekeeping was then seen as a suspect to the case.
A letter sighted by Citi News revealed that Prof. Frimpong-Boateng wrote a letter to the Police CID to investigate him over his alleged involvement in the missing earth-moving equipment.
Five other individuals who are believed to be accomplices of Mr. Ewusi were also arrested with him.
They are Frederick Ewusi, Joel Asamoah, Adam Haruna, Frank Gyan and John Arhin.
They have however been granted bail and expected to report to the Criminal Investigations Department later on Wednesday 5th February 2020.
Mr Ashigbey had earlier blasted the government for failing to devise stringent measures to ensure the safety of excavators that were seized by operatives of Operation Vanguard.
Speaking to Citi News‘ Umaru Sanda Amadu, Mr. Ashigbey wondered whether these seized excavators which were reportedly carted to designated areas for safekeeping were monitored by police officers.
Mr. Ashigbey indicated that these excavators would not have gone missing if the government had put in place the necessary measures to ensure their safety.
Meanwhile, he has also asked President  Akufo-Addo to dismiss Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) whose areas, small scale illegal mining activities continue to take place unabated.
According to him, this should be part of measures to deal with the upsurge of illegal mining in the country.
He indicated that beyond empowering state institutions, officials who are at the helm of affairs at the various districts must be held responsible for the menace.
A former Minerals Commission Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Tony Aubynn, says the fight against illegal mining in the last few years has clearly been lost.
“Have water bodies become clean? No. Have people stopped mining without the requisite licenses? No. It has even gone underground,” he remarked on Eyewitness News.
According to Dr. Aubynn, the metrics of success are clear when judging the compliance with the law and the state of the water bodies.
“You define all these things and the answer is obvious. We haven’t succeeded,” the former Minerals Commission’s boss stated.
Dr. Aubynn was on his way out of the Minerals Commission, in 2017, just as the fight against illegal mining was kicking into gear.
But at that time, he was confident that illegal small-scale mining, popularly known as galamsey, had stopped in the country following the intense media campaign and government action.
Under him, the government interdicted nine district mining officers of the Minerals Commission who were asked to proceed on indefinite leave, in May 2017.
The nine officers supervised mining activities in nine mining districts and were found to be negligent.
The Lands and Natural resources Minister at the time, John Peter Amewu, said they were negligent, as they allowed illegal mining to continue in their respective areas.
The Minerals Commission acts as the main promotional and regulatory body for the minerals sector in Ghana and is responsible for the regulation and management of the utilisation of the mineral resources of Ghana and the coordination and implementation of policies relating to mining.
Currently, the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) has warned that it will be forced to halt the production and supply of water if illegal small scale mining is not stopped.
The Western Regional Chief Manager of GWCL, Francis Agyei-Boateng, said rationing of water around this time each year has become more acute because of illegal mining.
Most of Ghana’s freshwater bodies have been heavily polluted with thousands of acres of fertile farmlands also destroyed as a result of the illegal mining.
Ghana was recently scored as 41% and ranked 80th country with the highest Corruption Perception by Transparency International, a body which measures annually the level of corruption in about 180 countries worldwide. 
After reading portions of the report, I was stuck between smiling or crying, either way, it was not pleasant what I read. 
A move from the 40% mark of last year as a perception of corruption in Ghana continuous to grow. 
What this simply means is that the perception we have about corruption and its related activities in Ghana has not changed but getting worse. 
Now I guess you understand my dilemma.
I kept asking myself, are we doing better as a country or we are perhaps at our ‘saturation’ level when it comes to corruption as a country? 
Irrespective of how I pondered about these questions, I arrived at a simple answer, probably not the answer I wanted, but it was perhaps the closest truth I could tell my wandering mind- we are not winning the fight against corruption.
I have read about a profound statement by a revered statesman when it comes to corruption. 
Former President J.A Kufuor is reported to have said ‘‘Corruption is as old as Adam’’. 
A statement I tend to agree with except the connotation it carries. 
Perhaps not what he meant to communicate as he will later clarify, but the baggage it conveys leaves me with no option than to steer away from it completely.  
Corruption has stayed with us from generations and its impact on our lives have been dire.
Corruption at any level should not be tolerated but that seems not the case in the system we live in. 
Greasing of palms and handing down cash or kind has gained notoriety in our politics, our public and civil services, our judiciary, our education system and virtually every aspect of our lives. 
The consequences of widespread corruption have a horrible effect on our country’s development. Ghana’s developmental agenda has delayed partly because of corruption over the years. 
Imagine monies meant for development syphoned by greedy public and civil servants through contracts and as a result, a community lacking basic social amenity such as water. 
Consider corruption activities bleeding our country of taxes at our Ministries, Agencies and Departments meant for development?
It is therefore not surprising the premium that is placed on the fight against corruption by the various political parties in their campaigns over the years, except to say that, they have failed abysmally at dealing with the canker. 
Government after the other since 1992 has promised to deal ruthlessly with corruption but the result after the promises leave much to be desired.
The setting-up of the Office of Special Prosecutor (OSP) by the NPP led Government was considered as a game-changer in the nation’s fight against the menace, but three years into its existence, little has been seen. 
The man put in charge of that office was an honourable, effective and efficient man, but that perhaps was when he was a private citizen. 
Maybe we should have left him as a ‘citizen vigilante’, by now we will have recovered the ‘Woyome’ money and many others. 
This by no means seeks to ridicule the office, maybe we will be reaping the fruits soon, but three years of ‘no show’, leaves me worried.
Perhaps the political chess game we play with the fight against bribery, exploitation and sleaze in our political and public services has not helped. 
Corruption fight is a non-negotiable matter in the interest of our country.  
But this is not an act only politicians and people in high authority engage in, private citizens and individuals are equal culprits when it comes to corruption. 
Remember, ‘the giver and the taker’ are both guilty? 
We have perhaps become numb as a people to the corruption that we are willing to pay each time even without request. 
Our national consciousness about corruption fight seem narrow and therefore need to be deepened. 
Our understanding of what constitutes corruption is blurred hence our pride in the act.
Lest I deviate, the war against illegal mining is rearing its ugly head again, our water bodies are turning brown, water treatment plants are about shutting down.
The ongoing illegal mining activities, popularly known as ‘galamsey’ affirms my position that maybe we have become numb to corruption or we are willing to be complicit in it. 
The long-held notion that ‘when the last tree dies, the last man dies’ has perhaps become an over flogged cliché that doesn’t strike to the core anymore. 
The media coalition against ‘galamsey’ along with government, fought the canker to some extent but the battle is far from over. 
The fight against ‘galamsey’ is imperative that needs no apathetic approach. 
We are losing our forest cover and losing our water bodies as well.
A recent publication about water shortage hitting part of the central region, Cape Coast to be specific struck me to the core. 
The publication suggests that the activities of illegal mining are leaving the water treatment plant in the region with no option than to ration water which in the long run will lead to a total shut-down. 
According to a report by JoyNews Central regional correspondent, ‘‘the Sekyere-Hermang water treatment plant is chocked with turgid water’’. 
I ask then, are we losing the fight against ‘galamsey’ too? I hope not. 
Because, ‘when the last water dries, the last man dies too’. 
It is perhaps overstretched, but I likened the effect of galamsey on corruption. 
They are both cancerous tissues that need to be dealt with, but we seem to be losing both fights.
President Akufo-Addo led administration ‘tried’ fighting the menace but it seems ‘galamsey’ is rather fighting it. 
Bodies such as GalamStop, Inter-Ministerial body, and other operations were launched to fight against corruption but none so far appears to have helped completely. 
The approach helped to some extent but our water bodies are still at the mercies of the cruel individuals who are bent on making money at the expense of the national good.
Some of the bodies set up to fight ‘galamsey’ have allegedly degenerated into extortion bodies, taking kickbacks and bribes at the expense of our country. 
While citizens are complicit in these acts as their role in fronting for foreign nationals smacks in the face for good citizenship, these multi-million ventures are sponsored by people in authority and well to do in society- people who have no good intentions for Ghana.
Many other approaches adopted to fight the canker continue to leave me in the dark as they have not been fruitful to the level worthy of praise. 
The adoption of technology in the fight was announced in 2018 but we seem to have gone to bed after the declaration just like others. While we have good intention is solving our problems, we never follow through to the needed result.
Lands and Natural Resources Minister, Mr Asomah-Cheremeh stated in September 2019 that, the government has achieved 85% success rate in the fight against ‘‘galamsey’’. 
While no evidence was given to substantiate this claim, I have no reason to doubt except to say, our rivers are still brown, indicating there is ‘galamsey’ still on-going. 
The Mineral and Mining Law has been amended with 15years minimum and 25years Maximum sentences, as well as 10,000 and 15,000 penalty units to ensure stiffer punishment but the recalcitrant are still doing it, perhaps with a planned cabal.
At the Meet-The-Press by the Lands and Natural resource minister, mining contributed $1.3 billion in 2019 as revenue, creating over 26,425 jobs by the large scale mining firms. 
The potential at the mining industry remains a viable one which when harnessed properly and through the legal channel will add a substantial amount to our revenue basket. But at no point should ‘galamsey’ be regularized since the result on the nation will be a disaster.
The fight against the twin-canker ‘corruption and galamsey’, that continue to obliterate our nation, need a concerted effort from us all. 
The importance of water and forest reserve can never be underestimated and thus should be guarded with all our might. 
Galamsey and Corruption have an awful consequence on our country’s development and the earlier we deal with them with all seriousness, the best it will be for generations yet unborn.
Dealing with corruption should be high on the agenda, teaching and practising integrity with rewards should be promoted and be seen at the fore-front in our education and religious institutions. 
Appropriate punishment should be encouraged and applied impartially. 
While the wheel of justice perhaps grinds slowly, fast-tracking cases of illegal mining, prosecuting and securing convictions could serve as a deterrent to the many who may want to engage in the illegal act.
We shouldn’t continue to sit detached and watch our natural resource blessings turn into a curse. 
Water is life, let’s not sit on the fence about the effect of ‘galamsey.’
God bless our homeland and make her great and strong.
It appears the about 500 excavators seized during the intense crusade against illegal small scale mining between 2017 and 2018, are not missing as alleged by the Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Professor Frimpong Boateng.
Members of the Concerned Small Scale Miners Union of Ghana say they know the whereabouts of the earth moving machines.
President of the Union, Richard Kojo Peprah speaking to Citi News said some of their members traced their excavators to various illegal mining sites in parts of the country.
“We were able to find some of these machines in Tamale. Some of these machines had tracking devices. 
So we are able to trace them.
When they take the machine in the Ashanti region then, they send it to the Northern region. 
They are engaged in one activity or the other. 
Some are even engaged in galamsey”.
The chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Professor Frimpong Boateng disclosed last week that most of the seized excavators are missing.
The minister is quoted as saying that “though the excavators were seized and taken to the district assemblies, the heavy-duty machines disappeared later from the premises of the assemblies”.
The Media Coalition against Illegal Mining and Occupy Ghana subsequently demanded from government explanations for the supposed disappearance of some excavators.
According to the two organisations, the authorities responsible for ensuring sanity within the mining sector have failed to enforce the law.
Convenor of the Media Coalition against Galamsey, Ken Ashigbey said persons behind the disappearance should be named to ensure they are sanctioned.
“If we don’t ensure that the laws that we have, are working, then the impunity will continue. 
How come some of the excavators cannot be found? 
It is also important that we know which public officers or individuals are responsible for this. 
That is something that we need answers for,” he said.
The Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal mining was set up to oversee the implementation of the ban on all forms of small scale mining and also see to the vetting of small scale miners.
It was commissioned in March 2017 by President Akufo-Addo to reform artisanal and small-scale mining in the country. 
It’s chaired by the minister of Environment, Science, Technology, and Innovation (MESTI), Professor Frimpong Boateng.
The Forestry Commission says unseen powerful persons are behind the resurgence of illegal mining in some forest reserves in the country.
One of such affected forest is the Bekwai Forest Reserve in the Amansie Central District in the Ashanti Region, where illegal miners have destroyed about seven hectares of land.
The Bekwai District Manager of the Forestry Commission, Rexford Twum-Damoah, told journalists that the situation is getting out of hand as the illegal miners sometimes enjoy military protection.
He said the illegal miners often refer to the powerful people as their bosses hence carry out the destructive activity with impunity.
Many forests across the country have been under threat of the activities of illegal miners who destroy tree cover and pollute water bodies in their quest to mine gold.
Citi News‘ Jonas Nyabor in a report on how illegal mining is wiping out Ghana’s forests in 2019 found that several hectares of fertile forestlands across the country have been destroyed due to the activities of illegal miners, especially within the last decade.
The Desiri, Kutukrom, Kobro, Oda, Jimira, Atewa, and Tano-Offin forests in the Ahafo, Western, Ashanti, Eastern regions have all suffered from the illegality.
Many rivers, including the Birim River in the Eastern Region and other water bodies, that take their source from these forests have as a result been left heavily polluted, depriving residents in nearby communities of a source of freshwater and putting at risk the lives of over five million other people in major cities in the south whose potable water are sourced from the forests.
In the report, it was found that although the forestry commission makes some arrest and ensures prosecution of persons who mine illegally in forest reserves, some of those who cause the worst destructions are able to escape prosecution or sometimes arrest due to the influence of powerful people in society.
An Accra High Court says Nii Amanoo Dodoo, the Receiver of the now-defunct uniBank, can testify in the trial of Dr. Kwabena Duffuor, founder of the bank, and other officials.
Mr. Dodoo was to be called as the State’s first witness in the trial, but lawyers for Dr. Duffuor prayed the court not to allow Mr. Dodoo to testify.
Dr. Duffuor’s lawyers argued that the Receiver had breached sections of the Banks and Specialized Deposit Act, 2016 hence their objection.
According to the lawyers, the presence of the first Prosecution Witness, Nii Dodoo does not qualify him to testify because he was appointed Receiver of uniBank after being a partner of KPMG which audited the accounts of the bank.
Mrs Yvonne Attakora Obuobisa, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), opposed the objection.
She admitted that Nii Dodoo was previously a partner of KPMG, indicating that KPMG did not hold any shares in uniBank neither did it hold any key position in uniBank.
The Director of Public Prosecution argued that KPMG had not violated any rule or statute and that the appointment of Nii Dodoo was from a private sector and was legitimate.
“The fact that he has worked with KPMG does not prevent Bank of Ghana from appointing him as receiver of uniBank,” he added.
Mrs Obuobisa said his appointment as the Receiver was lawful, urging the court to dismiss the objection since the witness met the requirement for qualifying to testify.
Justice Bright Mensah, Court of Appeal Judge, sitting as an additional High Court Judge, said, ” I uphold the argument of DPP that the appointment was not illegal or void.
The appointment of Nii Dodoo by BoG is valid.”
He said Section 59 of the Evidence Act explained who was not qualified to testify, which included someone who was incapable of coherent expression so as to be understood, directly or through interpretation by another person who could understand that person; or incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth.
Justice Mensah said he held the view that, the witness was qualified to testify and had personal knowledge of what was at hand.
“The appointment of the Receiver was valid,” he added.
He, however, said the Counsel for A1, A2 and A4 had impressed upon the court that, the evidence, he would give would be tainted with illegality because he was incapable to testify on those reports.
The Judge said that the argument was simplistic and that it could not be said that the method would be tainted with invalidity.
“The challenge of his validity should be a civil matter and that the witness is a competent and comparable witness,” the Court of Appeal Judge said.
The court, therefore asked the Receiver to take the oath and proceed to testify.
Dr. Kwabena Duffuor and 8 others are facing a total of 71 charges for various roles they played in what led to the collapse of some financial institutions.
The Ghana Association of Bankers says it largely welcomes the Bank of Ghana’s directives to banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions to stop a number of fees and charges slapped on customers for some services rendered.
The Association is however unhappy with the instruction for the financial institutions to stop deducting maintenance charges on savings accounts.
Speaking to Citi News, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Association, John Awuah, justified the charges on savings accounts, explaining that some savings accounts are technically operated like current accounts.
“The target is not even the banking industry. It has to do with other participants in the financial system. 
It is, for this reason, we support largely, not entirely, the cancellation of some charges. 
We need to treat the customers fairly.”‘
“Savings accounts are not meant for daily withdrawals. 
But, we see people link their MoMo wallets to it, use ATMs for withdrawing money from the account, etc. 
This makes the accounts lose their character. What the banks are saying is that, in cases where customers use accounts designated for investments as current accounts, they are to be levied accordingly. 
To that extent, we have a bit of a challenge,” he explained.
The Central Bank in a statement on Friday, June 18, 2021, directed banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions to desist from implementing seven different fees and charges, and also stop engaging in some practices that do not auger well for the banking sector.
The fees and charges, and practices which are identified by the central bank as unfair include, Credit Insurance Premium Overcharges, Maintenance Fees on Savings Account, among others, Over the Counter (OTC) Withdrawal Charges as well as the requirement by some banks for borrowers to make them part owners in some assets they present for use as collateral for loans.
A Banking consultant, Dr. Akwasi Atuahene, has urged the Bank of Ghana to take action against financial institutions that fail to implement these new directives.
The Bank of Ghana (BoG) on Friday, June 18, 2021, directed Banks and Specialized Deposit-Taking institutions in the country to stop charging unfair fees and charges.
Among other things, the central bank also ordered the financial institutions to stop unlawful practices that do not auger well for the financial sector.
“These practices are deemed to be unfair, inappropriate, and detrimental to the financial inclusion agenda and the protection of customers’ interest,” a statement from the BoG said.
The unfair charges, according to the Bank of Ghana, include, credit insurance premium overcharges, maintenance fees on savings accounts, over the counter withdrawal charges, among others.
Below are the seven unfair charges and fees, and the clear directives the BoG gave on them going forward:
As part of credit underwriting policies, a number of banks and SDIs require borrowers to hold credit insurance against eventualities such as death, permanent disability, and termination of employment. 
While the Bank of Ghana acknowledges the importance of this practice as a loss mitigating norm in credit management, a number of banks and SDIs take advantage, to overprice the premiums charged to customers, resulting in the increased cost of borrowing. 
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from premium overcharges and to adhere strictly to the following:
Banks and SDIs that opt to use their pre-determined insurance companies to underwrite borrowers’ loans, shall apply the same premium charged by the underwriting company to borrowers.
Banks and SDIs are not permitted to retain insurance premiums collected from customers with the intention of implementing an internal insurance policy.
This excludes commissions for Bancassurance arrangements.
The application of “Account Maintenance Fees” by banks and SDIs on savings accounts inhibits deposit mobilisation and discourages the use of banking systems by the public. 
Bank of Ghana has noted that the application of such fees has driven a number of savings accounts into debt and, in so doing, eroded the deposits of vulnerable depositors who would generally expect their savings accounts to earn interest.
This practice is detrimental to financial inclusion and negates the gains of the financial literacy programmes geared towards promoting personal savings.
Bank of Ghana notes that some banks and SDIs impose penal charges on customers who withdraw their own funds from banking halls of affected banks and SDIs. 
The reason commonly attributed to this practice is to encourage customers to use digital platforms provided by the banks/SDIs for such withdrawals, in order to decongest banking halls. 
These digital platforms are however not offered for free.
While the Bank of Ghana acknowledges the support of banks and SDIs in the digitization agenda, this action deters some customers, especially those who are averse to the use of digital platforms, from opening and operating accounts. 
The practice also negatively affects the financial inclusion drive of the Bank of Ghana.
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from levying penalties on customers who withdraw their own funds below certain thresholds from the banking halls.
In addition, banks and SDIs shall not levy penalties against customers who request account balances within banking halls.
Bank of Ghana notes that some banks and SDIs require borrowers who secure credit facilities with movable assets, to transfer ownership of such assets into the joint names of the borrower and the bank or SDI involved. 
In addition, borrowers are made to bear the cost associated with the transfer prior to loan approval and after the settlement of the loan.
This practice of some banks and SDIs is contrary to section 7 of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052) which does not permit a security interest to operate as a transfer of title from a borrower to a lender. 
The practice further denies borrowers the opportunity to secure multiple loans with single collateral duly registered in the name of the respective borrowers.
Banks and SDIs are barred from engaging in the practice of changing ownership of collaterals presented by borrowers to secure credit facilities from the borrower to the bank or SDI.
The Bank of Ghana has observed a practice among some banks and SDIs, where penal interest rates levied against defaulting loan customers, are made to accrue interest. 
In effect, interest is computed on penal charges in addition to interest on the outstanding loan amount.
This practice results in high outstanding loan balances which customers are unable to pay, resulting in high non-performing loans.
The practice is detrimental to the credit market. 
Banks and SDIs are directed to desist from the application of interest on penal charges.
Additionally, penal charges shall only be applied on the amount of the delayed interest or principal payment and not on the total outstanding loan amount in accordance with section 55(3) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052).
In accordance with section 55 (2) of the Borrowers and Lenders Act, 2020 (Act 1052), banks and SDIs shall impose on a borrower an interest rate that is calculated on an Annual Basis only in all credit agreements.
Consequently, banks and SDIs are directed to desist from the quotation of monthly interest rates on all credit facilities and associated fees.
In addition to the interest rate, banks and SDIs are directed to disclose the Annualized Percentage Rate (APR) related to every credit facility in accordance with the Disclosure and Product Transparency Rules for Credit Products and Services.
Bank of Ghana has observed with concern, the lack of compliance with the requirement of banks and SDIs to obtain full personal details (name, address, ID, and telephone numbers) of a person who makes a deposit into or withdrawal from an account on behalf of another person. Deposit slips of some banks and SDIs do not make provision for depositors’ signatures. 
This anomaly makes it possible for third parties to deposit into the customer’s account under the guise that the deposit was made by the customer, by simply writing “self” in the column for the depositor’s name.
Telecommunication company, MTN, has handed over a 300,000 Cedi blood bank facility to the management of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Unit at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, with a call on Ghanaians to support the work of the National Blood Service by donating blood.
The handing-over ceremony coincided with the World Blood Donors day celebration.
The Chief Corporate Services Executive of MTN Ghana, Samuel Koranteng, said, “the provision of the facility is a unique opportunity to leave a lasting legacy for our blood donation exercises over the years. 
The construction of this facility, therefore, serves as a good symbolism of our contribution to the collection and storage of blood in Ghana”.
“We are even more excited because we are making a significant contribution to the health needs of the people of this country”, he emphasized.
Samuel Koranteng maintained that the significance of blood in healthcare delivery, especially in emergency cases and in cases of obstetric hemorrhage, cannot be overemphasized.
“… Because of the need, the MTN Foundation instituted an annual blood donation exercise which has over the years yielded 20,036 pints of blood”.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital, Dr Eric Kofi Ngyedu, disclosed that the hospital recorded twenty-six maternal deaths in 2020.
“Though a reduction from the previous year’s figure of twenty-eight, the situation is still extremely unacceptable”.
Dr. Ngyedu thanked MTN for the kind gesture “to support the hospital to improve maternal health outcomes”.
Many Ghanaians were hopeful when the government introduced the One District One Factory (1D1F) initiative, which is aimed at building strong value-addition-oriented companies as well as reducing the unemployment rate in the country.
Although some private companies have received some forms of support under the initiative, many have not received the support needed as access to funds has been a challenge.
In a bid to address this, the Managing Director of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), Dr. John Kofi Mensah, says the bank is offering support to Ghanaians who are into agribusiness by financing out-grower schemes under the one district one factory initiative.
“One district one factory was brought by our president, and we are trying to move it to another level as an agricultural focused bank to finance out-grower schemes for the one district one factory initiative. 
That is, the factories and the industries that are being established, we want to fund the input base, and most of them are agro. 
Let’s take, for example, the Ekumfi Juice factory in the Central Region which was commissioned by the President, ADB is financing the input base, that is pineapple. 
We have already pumped thirty million cedis into an out-grower scheme for farmers in pineapple production. 
Another one I can talk of is the Tomato processing factory at Berekum in the Bono Region.”
“We are financing an out-grower scheme for tomato production. 
So any Ghanaian who wants to go into agro-based processing should be sure that when you come to talk to ADB, we will support you to build a raw material base by financing an out-grower scheme so, that, your factory will continue producing without any break. 
We are concentrating on Ghana production in terms of the raw materials and most of them are agro-based.”
Another industry in Ghana that has been struggling over the years is the poultry industry.
The Managing Director of ADB, Dr. John Kofi Mensah says in order for local poultry farmers to be globally competitive, his outfit has introduced a broiler value chain scheme where various players are given financial support with favourable interest rates.
“We have also introduced a broiler value chain scheme where we finance value chains from the hatchery to production, processing to marketing. 
We have identified interest rate as an issue, and we are promising our value chain customers that we are going to see to the further suppression of the interest rate”.
The Managing Director made these comments on the sidelines of a dinner with some selected customers of the bank in Kumasi.
The Board Chair of ADB, Alex Bernasko said, although COVID-19 hit various institutions hard, ADB was able to make a profit of 65 million Ghana Cedis in 2020, and even introduced flexible terms to suit its customers.
The Board Chair added that the bank is set to introduce a three-year strategic plan to make it much stronger.
“When the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced, we came up with a few strategies to lighten the burden of our customers. 
In fact, one of them was to introduce a moratorium on existing facilities. 
Apart from that, some of them were given restructured payment schedule to enable them enough time to pay. 
You will also appreciate that some of the charges have been reduced and all that for the benefit of the customers to make life less worrisome for them. But generally, ADB has got a three-year strategic plan which is intended to improve its structures and systems and way of doing work”.
The board members of ADB as part of their visit to the Ashanti Region paid a courtesy call on the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II.
The Asantehene commended the bank for its focus on agriculture and urged it to continue to offer support to various businesses.
The Minister for Works and Housing, Francis Asenso Boakye, has disclosed that the government is partnering with the World Bank to invest $200 million in measures to tackle flooding in Accra.
According to him, this forms part of the government’s vision to end the perennial flooding in the capital city.
Mr. Asenso Boakye made this known in a press statement issued on Thursday, June 3, 2021, in commemoration of the June 3 disaster in 2015, which claimed 152 lives and injured many others.
“In line with this, the government has collaborated with the World Bank to invest $200 million to, among others, implement the Greater Accra Resilient and Integrated Development (GARID) project.”
The Minister also added that the Akufo-Addo government will also “intensify efforts aimed at finding lasting solutions to the perennial flooding in Accra and other parts of the country.”
Meanwhile, Mr. Asenso Boakye also charged the citizenry to aid the government in this endeavour.
According to him, the government alone cannot end the menace if citizens do not also change their attitudes.
The project is meant to mitigate flood risks and address the solid waste management challenges in the Odaw Drainage Basin.
It also involves the reconstruction of some bridges to remove identified impediments to the flow of water in the basin when it rains, and the construction of detention ponds upstream of the Odaw Basin, to hold large volumes of water that would otherwise lead to flooding, especially around Kwame Nkrumah Circle.
